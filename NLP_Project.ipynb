              " 'Performed at the Celebrity Star Theater in Phoenix on July 23, 1978',\n",
              " 'Hi, this is George Carlin, and I thought we might take a look at some of the pictures from the days when my show business career was just starting. This is one of the earliest photos of my days as an actor. Here I’m playing the part of a baby in an early production of a play called “Hold Onto The Rail.” As proof of the intensity I brought to the role, lying nearby you can see a doll that I had recently strangled. This is a candid photo of my first manager and I having a business conference in the park, where we knew we couldn’t be bugged. In this photo I am trying out a new funny face that I had been working on for about six months. Now, here I am with, uh, two of my fellow actors from the West Harlem production of either Ben Hur or the Sound of Music. You can’t really tell from what we’re wearing there because those are our street clothes. And the person off to one side is our personal manager who insisted on being in all of our publicity photos. This is a rare photo, uh, this is a photo of me in a singing group called The Mills Brothers. Uh, we didn’t know that there was already a group in existence by that name. The Mills Brothers sued us, so we dropped two guys and changed the named to Mickey and Sylvia. This is a picture of the time I came in second in a suntan contest. The boy in the middle won, but it was, uh, later he was disqualified when it was discovered he had been using pep pills. Uh, this is the same photo with the negative reversed. As you can see, the suntans are approximately the same on the back. This is me during an early suicide attempt. I was despondent at that time because my puberty was coming along very slowly. This one was taken during the nationwide search for a replacement for Lassie. I remember this picture. I’m trying to get my dog Spotty, a fox terrier, to stand up straight and act like a collie. Uh, although he didn’t get the part, later he did go on to become Mars the Cat God, rest his soul’s manager. This is a picture of me and the boy who doubled for me during my early film career. Normally I did all my own stunts except for the scenes involving homosexuality, of course, and this boy served that purpose. This is me singing in a trio I had started which was called The Inkspots. Oddly enough, the NAACP sued the trio and forced me to drop out when I couldn’t prove there was such a thing as flesh colored ink. This is my first communion picture. It was so well received that I decided to use it for publicity, and to this day, this is the picture that I send out when producers call and ask me if I’m interested in serious acting.',\n",
              " 'And that brings me to today, here in Phoenix, Arizona, where we’re going to shoot one of these comedy shows for the first time in the round. So I’ll see you around. All right, now, I’m starting to feel it Marty. Let’s go, Marty. All right. No, I want to do like, this is what guys who run do, sprinters do this, 60-yard dash. I always wonder if they’re gonna run on their fingers or what. Okay, getting ready to go. Hey, how are you there? Okay, we’re getting ready to go. We’re getting ready. All right, we’re going to hire you on good judge of character. Hi, how are you? Looks like you made it all the way out to the van during half-time. That’s good. Any time. What? Go. I can go out, on-stage? Yeah. Oh, all right. Ah, yes, thank you. Thank you. Very nice, thank you very much. Well, thank you. Well, I do thank you. And you all got here. Imagine that, we all got here. That’s what always knocks me out about the audience, the audience comes from everywhere. Audiences come from all different houses, different apartments, all over town, different rooms. Imagine that, you had to leave your room and come on to the theater. Maybe you had to drive here, that’s how a lot of us got here. You had to get in and drive the big iron thing, trying real hard not to hit anyone else in the other big iron things. But we got here. Now, all we have to do is get back again. I do think about the audience, though, I’m in the audience, too. You know, I mean, I feel like I’m in the audience, I just happen to have the best seat in the house, that’s all. I am in the audience, and I know the things you think of. I think of them too. When I’m driving to the theater going to be in the audience I’m thinking to myself, what kind of a member of the audience will I be tonight? Will I be a credit to my row? Will we win row of the year? Suppose we get some shit from another section? If there’s a fire drill, will I file out safely, or trample the shit out of my neighbor? Pardon me, fire, look out, fire, pardon me, fire, fire, look out, pardon me, fire. We never practice that one, do we, panicking. We never practice panicking, we practice going out neatly, pardon me, fire, look out, pardon me, fire, fire, yeah, pardon me, fire. We never do that, I don’t know why we practice so much. If we could learn to climb over one another, we might save a few lives.',\n",
              " 'I wonder, I wonder a lot of things. I wonder what it’s like when I’m not there. Do you wonder what it’s like when you’re not there anymore, when you’re gone? You know, you were somewhere, you were over here with your friends and you’re talking some shit with them. You say we’ll see you later, Phil, we’re going downtown, and then you leave. Do you wonder what it’s like over there now? I wonder are they gonna treat me right while I’m gone? What’s it like? I wonder a lot of things, but that’s my job. My job is thinking up goofy shit. You know, that’s my job, thinking up goofy shit. My job is to think up stuff and come around and remind you of it. Cause you already knew it, you just forgot to laugh at it, that’s all. My job to remind you. I wonder about things like, I wonder if on a rainy night the sandman sends the mudman. You’d think it would be his job. I wonder why we don’t have any large craft warnings. Apparently we don’t care about the big boats, huh? I wonder why Marineland doesn’t have a display of fish sticks. I mean, it’s a seafood, I’d like to see it. In fact, I’d like to see Mrs. Paul herself come swimming by. Hi, boys. I wonder if a centipede wants to kick another centipede in the shins, does he kick one leg at a time, or does he stand on 50 and kick with 50? I wonder why there are not waiters in waiting rooms. They’re all in the restaurant. I wonder why women wear evening gowns to nightclubs. Why don’t they wear nightgowns? And I wonder why fluorescent lights seem afraid to come on. Have you ever noticed, you turn them on and they go blip, blip, blip, blip, blip… finally they’ll come on after you coax them a little. I wonder why Kleenex doesn’t have a target in the middle of it. Don’t you think we need a bulls-eye right in the middle of the Kleenex? I wonder about hats. Did you ever notice that when you have a hat on for a long time, it feels like it’s not there. And then when you take it off, it feels like it’s still there. That’s creepy. I wonder about frog’s legs. In those restaurants where they serve frog’s legs, what do they do with the rest of the frog? What, do they just throw it away? I mean, they don’t have frog torsos on the menu. They must be doing something with them. They throw them away. Can you imagine a barrel full of frog bodies in the restaurant and some drunk coming down the alley, oh, goddamn. I wouldn’t wanna see that. I wonder about who empties wishing wells. Who the hell empties the wishing wells? That’s our money. I’ve never seen an accounting. Does anybody ever tell you, no, gone, just gone. Someone picked it up, someone emptied the well. I’m sure they don’t come around at 3:00 in the afternoon on Sunday with a little girl in her first communion dress dropping a dime. 3:00 in the morning, black T-shirts empty the wishing well. It’s our money and I want some of it back. I wonder if movie directors have credits on their dreams. And I wonder why there’s no blue food. Where the hell is the blue food? Every other food is represented… I mean, every other color, every other color is represented. I mean, every color… okay, red is raspberry, cherry and strawberry, orange is orange, yellow is lemon, green is lime, brown is meat. There’s no blue food. Why the hell was blue left out of the food thing? Somebody’s got the blue food, goddammit. Somebody’s got it. It probably bestows immortality, that’s why we haven’t been given any. And don’t say blueberries, we know they’re purple. You look at a blueberry and you see that sucker is purple. Bleu cheese, no, bleu cheese is just white cheese with a bunch of mold in it, man. And bluefish, God knows, you open one up they’re every color under the sun. Well, enough of that shit. I wonder, I wonder which came first, skilled workers or unskilled, and who decided? I figure originally all we had was workers, and then they decided, this is hard. And they called themselves skilled. And someone else came along they couldn’t do it, poor unskilled son of a bitch. They moved right past his ass, man, when he was just in the landing area. Do you think maybe Charlie McCarthy has little wooden balls? I’ve always wondered that. Hi, Charlie, hi, Charlie. You know what I wonder about, I wonder we buy flowers. Why do we buy flowers? They’re free. They grow all over. Yet, we buy them, we pay good money for flowers, flowers that are dying, I might add. That’s a little strange, flowers is one, flowers is one of the few things that you buy, you bring it to your house, and if they die you don’t give a shit. Normally, you’d be asking for your money back on anything that died. Are you kidding me, these things keeled over on the piano. Flowers. I wonder why I’ve never seen anyone cleaning a church. Have you? I’ve never seen someone cleaning a church. A lot of things go on in church. You never see a cleaning crew going in there with pails and mops and shit. It just never happens. Why don’t they clean churches? You know why? Churches don’t need to be cleaned, they clean themselves overnight. That’s how they know they’re churches. Come back the next morning, shit, it’s still clean, must be a church.',\n",
              " 'Does the time bother you? I get bothered by the time. Not so much the time itself, the people bother me for the time. People come up to me on the street, I’m sure you’ve had this happen to you, people come up to you and say what time it is, or they might say what time is it? I shouldn’t get into these ballads. You’ve had people come up to you and say, what time is it? What time is it? As if you personally were responsible for keeping time. You know, I feel, I feel honored, first of all, that they thought I was the man in charge. But I do have to explain, you don’t see official timekeeper on here, do you? I don’t have the time of course not. Do you have the time? That’s another way they say it, do you have the time? I say, uh, no, I don’t believe I do. I certainly didn’t have it this morning. Did you leave it somewhere? Well, do you have the time? No, I don’t have the time. I use a little of it like everyone, you know, but I don’t have it. I think, I think the Navy has it, in Washington. Isn’t that, they keep it in an observatory, that’s right. Sure, they let out a little of it each day. Not too much, they wouldn’t want to give us too much, just enough time. Sometimes they’ll say, do you know what time it is? And I say, yes. I hate to disappoint them, but there is no time. There is no time. I don’t mean there’s no time, I mean there’s no time. When the hell is it? We made that whole thing up. There’s no time, we made it up. It’s a manmade invention, time. There are no numbers up in the sky. I’ve looked, they’re not there. We made this stuff up, when is it? When the hell is it, when are we, I ask you, when are we? Sometimes we think we know where we are, but we don’t really know when we are. When the hell is it? All the time zones are different, every calendar you run across is different. They’ll all give you a different answer. These are calendars, these are made to… to keep track of time. Everybody’s got a different one. The Chinese are way up there in the 5 and 6000’s, Hebrew calendar is way up in the 5 and 6000’s, we’re up at about 1977. Well, shit, this ain’t a couple of weeks these people are off, this is thousands of goddamn years that are missing, man. How did they do that? We don’t, we don’t know when the hell is it, it could be the middle of last month, for all we know. I mean, time is so, we’ve got it down so perfect that every four years we have to stick in an extra day just to make sure it still works, and we call it February 29th. Bullshit, it’s March 1st and I know it. It just feels like March 1st. You can’t keep track of the time, what’s the sense. Give you an example, there’s a moment coming, it’s not here yet, it’s still on the way, it’s in the future, it hasn’t arrived, here it comes, here it is, oh, shit, it’s gone. There’s no now, there’s no now, everything is the near future or the recent past. But there’s no present. Welcome to the present, whoosh, gone again. It’s just so imprecise. We don’t even care to use the minutes and seconds and hours that we’ve been given, everybody’s very vague about the time. They say what time you got, I got, uh, I got just after. Just after, geez, I must be slow, I had going on. And where did that imprecision begin? Why is it we’re not so sure? I know one of the clues that happened to me was when they started telling me about moments when I was a kid. They were trying to teach me how to tell time, and of course, you can’t tell time, time tells you. But they were trying, they were trying to show me. Now the big hand, I said I don’t have a big hand. Never mind, look at the clock. And the clock is so wonderful, there’s so much emotion attached to a clock face. I hate digital clocks. Digital clocks rob me of all the emotional experience of the spatial relationships on that face of the clock. Isn’t it true, I mean, don’t you always feel that this half hour when it comes down from 12 down to 6 goes by a lot quicker than this half hour when it has to come up fighting gravity all the way? I know, it does go a lot quicker, yeah. Oh, I got ya, yeah. I’ll tell ya, I’ll tell ya this, if I only have a half to live, I want it to be this one, man. I wanna last just a little bit longer than this one here. It’s vague, that’s all I’m saying, it’s very vague how we treat time. We have all these wonderful expressions, we say now, now is an interesting one. When, now, you want that now? Yes. Well, would you like to try again. Or sometimes just now, just now, did you hear that? What? Just now. You must mean just then, don’t you? Yes, just then, but there it goes again. When? – Now? – No, not now. Pardon me, do you have the time? When do you mean, now or when you asked me? This shit is moving, Ruth. We got a lot of these vague terms, right away, immediately, at once, lickety split, just like that, nothing flat, drop of a hat, no time at all, as quick as you can say Jack Robinson. I’m sure you’ve done that to people, I’ll be back before you can say Jack Robinson. Jack Robinson, you’re not back. How about, a jiffy, a jiffy, or a flash? Which is quicker? A jiffy or a flash? I think there are two flashes in a jiffy, myself. But God knows how many jiffies there are in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. And why did they use two shakes of a lamb’s tail, what’s wrong with the basic unit of measurement, one shake of a lamb’s tail? We can do our own arithmetic, thank you. Belched a little there. Tried to swallow that one. Then we have words like soon. Soon, that’s a very emotional word, there’s a lot of potential for drama in that word, soon. Soon, soon, is your mother coming home? Uh-huh. When? Soon. Real soon. As soon as she can. Sooner than you think, that’s kind of a spooky one, Sooner than I think? That’s a little bit like before you know it. I’ll be back before you know it. He did it, holy Christ, look at that. And we go on with these terms that we use, these vague terms of time, one of these days, before long, any time now. Well, that’s true, everything is gonna happen any time now. Any day now, that’s kind of a snotty one, any day now. Hey, I’ll be giving you that five bucks I owe you, Bill. Yeah, any day now. Sooner or later, now and then, once in a while, from time to time, in a little while. In a little while, that will just be a little while. That’s a wonderful one, and I just love that. It sounds so benign, just a little while. Couldn’t hurt you, could it? You can wait a little while. It’ll only be a little while longer, just a little while. That’s so different from a short time. Short time sounds sound almost terminal, doesn’t it? You only have a short time. Whereas you have a little while. Oh, I’d rather have a little while than a short time. You know, we’ve got long ways we measure time, we’ve got vast distances of time we measure. People will say things like kingdom come, I’m… I’m gonna be standing here till kingdom come. Shit, I don’t have that on my watch. Doomsday, you say? Doomsday. Till the cows come home. Now, that’s an easy one to understand, that’s long about dusk, isn’t it? If you leave them out overnight they’d burst. Here’s a long period of time, forever. Some people will tell you, gosh, I’ve been standing on this line forever. Look at this, Dave, this man has been standing on line forever. He looks fairly fresh to me. Almost like an eternity, people will tell you, it’s… it’s almost like an eternity, as if they had experience with eternities. Now, you must have a favorite period of time. I have some favorites, I just want to try a few of them on you. It isn’t easy, uh, to select a favorite period of time, so many of them are attractive, but there are little periods of time that, um, that you might relate to. Of course, the most basic period of time I feel is five minutes. That seems to be the one everyone chooses. If they need to think of a period of time real quickly, they just go five minutes, just five minutes, I’ll be there in just five minutes, give me five minutes, would you please just, would you just give me five minutes? Are you kidding me, I can fix that shit in five minutes. Five minutes, that’s all most people want, five minutes, a good, solid, nice period of time. You can do anything for five minutes, can’t you? I mean anything. Even things you really hate. Yeah, you can probably do it for five minutes. Hey, let’s go talk to Ted. Are you kidding? Ted’s an asshole. Look, just five minutes, huh? Okay, let’s give him five minutes. Not ten, ten I can’t make, now you’re getting into double digits, you’re starting to fool with my head. Time, five, ten minutes. Fifteen minutes is popular, you hear fifteen quite a bit. But it’s, it’s sort of an institutional one, it’s kind of an official time period, 15 minutes. Has a touch of regulatory, uh, quality to it, doesn’t it? It sounds like something you’re not supposed to do, or have to do for 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes. I like 20 minutes. Doesn’t that sound free compared to 15, 15 minutes? Twenty minutes. I’ll be back in 20 minutes. Gosh, what’s he gonna do?',\n",
              " 'Do you have those news stories for me? Maybe let’s go to the news reports, man. Tell us what’s going on around the world. God knows you’re not home to find out.

I was, the one you were gonna moan about, I was gonna tell a man… about a man who was scheduled for a heart transplant who decided not to have it. He had a change of heart, you know? I love that shit, that’s why… I know why you’re moaning, because you wish you had thought of the goddamn thing yourself. I have to think that. Like to wind up the news tonight with sort of a little story, kind of a human interest story about man’s best friend. It seems that 65-year-old James Driscoll was asleep in his downtown hotel room last Wednesday when he was awakened by the sound of a dog barking. When he woke, he found the room was full of smoke, he could not see, and the dog led him out of the room, down the hall, and into an elevator shaft where he plunged eight stories to his death.',\n",
              " 'I want to do a… a nostalgic thing here for my own sake and for the request of a couple of people that are on the crew that are listening or looking through viewers, or listening on headsets or whatever, and do a little, uh, weather forecast from Al Sleet, Al Sleet, the hippy-dippy weatherman. Hey, baby, what’s happening. Que pasa? Que what you call your pasa? Al Sleet here, your hippy-dippy weatherman, with all the hippy-dippy weather, man. Brought to you by Parson’s Pest Control. Do you have termites, waterbugs and roaches? Well, Parson’s will help you get rid of the termites and waterbugs, and help you smoke the roaches. Hey. Temperature at the airport is 88 degrees, which is stupid, man, cause I don’t know anybody who lives at the airport. Now if you’ll take a look at our national weather map, you’ll see that we don’t have one. So try to picture last night’s map in your mind. Remember all the letters and lines, all them little numbers. The weather is dominated by a large Canadian low, which is not to be confused with a Mexican high. Tonight’s forecast, dark, continued dark tonight, turning to partly light in the morning. Old Al, Al got out of the weather business and he’s, uh, he’s now a, a linoleum, uh, quality control inspector in a linoleum plant. Al, he only wanted to get out of the media. You know, he said fuck it, I don’t need it. And, uh, hey, who can blame him. I don’t know, but Al got out of weather when he realized he had given the… the final weather forecast. He had given the ultimate forecast, there was nowhere to go. You know, when there’s nothing left to conquer in your field, hey, it’s time to leave. And old Al had given the ultimate forecast, he told us, he said one night that the weather will continue to change on and off for a long, long time. Then he was gone from it. God bless Al.',\n",
              " 'Okay. Yes, you’re all, you’re all going to die. Didn’t mean to remind you of it, but it is on your schedule. Yes, it probably won’t happen when you want. It usually comes along when you’re not expecting. Generally you have your stamp collection out, you know? Now? Now. Just want a little time to put away your hinges, you know? No, there’s a time to die, and it’s okay, you know? It’s really okay. Nobody wants to die, nobody. Well, you know, ha ha, most people don’t wanna die. Nobody wants to die. Boy, if you think being sick is no fun, dying is really a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to die. People don’t mind being dead, being dead is great, but getting dead, nobody wants to get dead. So I hope I don’t die. I wonder how often we think that, you know? It’s just under the surface, isn’t it? You go out for the day, going out of your house, geez, I hope I don’t die. It would really spoil the circus if I were to die. Geez, I hope I don’t die. Comedians don’t wanna die. It’s only a metaphor, but it’s true of all of us, we don’t wanna die out there. A comic’s gonna die, I don’t want to die. Geez, I was dying out there, I was dying, it was death out there. It was like a morgue. I don’t wanna die. Of course, if the comedian doesn’t die, you know? If he succeeds, if he makes you laugh, then he can say, I killed ’em. I killed ’em. So, it’s either me or you, you know, just like on the freeway. Yeah, dying shouldn’t be that bad, it shouldn’t be that bad. We’re all gonna do it, it’s one of the few fair things in life, everybody catches it once. And dying should be fun, there should be some sort of a look ahead. I mean, after all, when you die you’re gonna find out where you go. Haven’t we been wondering about that a long time, where the hell we go. Isn’t that the biggest thing we have to wonder about, where the hell do you go? I don’t know. Joe thinks he knows. I know Joe thinks he knows, but Joe don’t know. Where do we go? Nobody knows. Well, I think sometimes you go where you think you’re gonna go, whatever you think you’re gonna do, that’s where you’re probably gonna go. If you keep saying you’re gonna go somewhere, chances are you might go there. You ever hear those guys say, I’m going to hell, don’t pray for me. Don’t pray for me, I’m going to hell. He is. You go where you wanna go. I think when you die, your soul goes to a garage in Buffalo. When Monte Hall dies, he’ll go behind Door Number 4. That’s it, where you wanna go. No, nobody wants to die, and you know part of the reason we don’t wanna die is because of that goddamn funeral. We’ve seen it, we know how bad news it is. That funeral is no fun. Man, if I don’t like other people’s funerals, I know I’m not gonna like my own, man. There’s no way I can get behind my own funeral. Gonna be lying there in a casket, they’re gonna put me in the box, gonna put me in a convertible with the top down. You know that’s embarrassing, lying there and everybody’s looking at you. You’re dead, and they’re looking. You’re just lying there still, people coming over going… they don’t know that you’re lying there with short pants on and no back in your jacket, embarrassing. And sometimes they’ll come over, you know, some people it depends on your religion and so forth, but they do come right over to the casket a lot of times and they’ll go like this. And they’re silent for a moment, and what they’re doing while they’re silent is, they’re subtracting their age from your age, so they get a rough estimate on what they have left. And they get up and they say, don’t he look good? Don’t he look good? You crazy, he’s dead. I know, but he never looked that good. Well, they say the nicest things about you, they say the nicest things when you die. Your popularity goes straight up when you die. They say the greatest things there are that can be said, they’ll even make stuff up if they have to. Well, he was a real asshole, but he meant well, you know? He was a well-meaning asshole. Yes, you get so popular when you die, all the flowers you get, think of the flowers you get when you die. You get more flowers when you die than you got in your whole life. All your flowers arrive at once, too late. And guys will say, oh, yeah, well, you know Bill is dead, yeah, poor Bill, poor Bill is dead, yeah. Poor Dave, yeah, poor Dave is gone now. Ed, yeah, poor Ed is gone. Dan, that motherfucker is still alive, isn’t he? I wish he would die so I could like him. Reincarnation is another aspect of death that a lot of people will tell you little tales about it. Reincarnation, coming back, a lot of folks are sure of it, they can come back, you come back as something. I don’t know, does it seem right to you that it would work? I mean, mathematically, it doesn’t seem to work, because originally on this earth we only had, well, let’s say six people. I know we had two, but it’s a controversial number. Let’s say at one time there were only, there were only six of us, about, six people, six souls. And those six people died, and those souls went back to the staging area, and new people were born and those six souls came back. We still only have six souls. Now, we have four billion people claiming to have souls. Where are all these extra souls coming from? Someone is printing up souls, and it lowers their value. The more souls there are, the less they’re worth, it would seem. Well, somebody’s got to think of this shit, you know? How about the perfect murder, I’ve thought sometimes about the perfect murder. You know what you do, you pick up one person by the ankles and you beat another person to death with him. And they both die, and there’s no murder weapon, hey. What happened here, sergeant? Looks like a pedestrian accident to me. They must have been moving at quite a clip. Of course, if you should be caught with this perfect murder in progress, or even after the fact, if you should be caught you might wind up on death row. Death row, wow. That’s more than just fun, ain’t it? I mean, there’s cats there, death row, man, shit. Oh, well, you got that one meal, but that’s not much of a consolation, is it? You’re gonna get to order your meal, big deal. Why don’t you leave me alone, I’m not hungry, man. They give you that one last meal. I say, you can have some fun with that last meal. I mean, if you work it right. They gotta give you whatever you want. I mean, short of elephant steak, you know? They don’t wanna start on a new elephant just for one guy. But they gotta give you pretty much what you want, that’s part of the humanity of what they’re going to do to you. Yeah, you could just order something, you know, like maybe, well, shit, you tell them you can’t decide. That’s it, I can’t decide. I don’t know, I don’t know if I want steak or lobster, you know? I mean, I really love them both and I honestly can’t decide. Could they kill you? I don’t think they could kill you if you honestly couldn’t decide. Lie detector, truth serum, the man honestly doesn’t know what he wants. We can’t very well kill him, we can’t drag him down the last mile screaming, I don’t know what I want. You gotta give him a chance, and then he… well, man lives. Imagine if you worked it out and you kept it going six months, man is still alive, can’t decide on meal. Three years, eight years, and then finally you’re an honest person so you tell them when you do figure it out, and you say I’ve decided what I’d like, I think I’ll have steak. Okay, how did you want that? Oh. Well, my feeling is, if you’re gonna die, you know, or if you know, hey, die big. Die big. Nobody wants to just pass away. You don’t want to be a euphemism, do you? Nobody wants to pass away. You know, Arnie passed away. Oh, really? Yes. Well, I didn’t know that. Well, that’s the idea. On the other hand, Dave died. Oh, yes, I heard about Dave dying. That’s true. I say die big, give it a shot, man, go out big, it’s your chance. Die big, work in a few posthumous reflexes for your friends. Give them a show before you go. Entertain and uplift and instruct those you are leaving behind. When you die, give them a few posthumous reflexes. You know, the body does store electricity up, there’s a certain storage of electricity, and even a dead body, a corpse, will occasionally go (sound). And I say if you have that potential after you’re dead, use it properly. Pre-program, before you die, pre-program some posthumous reflexes that will be entertaining to those you’ve left behind. Do something to capture their imagination, roll over on the autopsy table. That’s nice. Cross your legs, scratch your balls, do something. Now, the only reason, the only reason that I even suggest that you have a choice about what you can do at the moment of death, is a very little known and very little understood part of the death process called the two-minute warning. Many people are not aware of it at all, the two-minute warning. Just as in football, two minutes before you die you receive an audible warning, two minutes, get your shit together. The reason we don’t know about it is because the only people who hear it, die. And I don’t think we’d believe someone anyway if he told us he’d received his two-minute warning, would you? Some asshole on the bus, hey, I just got my two-minute warning. You’d think it was a coach out on the town, you know? But no, the two-minute warning does arrive, and I say use that time to entertain, to leave something behind. Do something with the two minutes, hey, if nothing else give a speech, a little two-minute speech. We can all give a little two-minute speech. Just pick some subject you’re very fond of and talk about it for two minutes, I mean, tell them. It’s your last chance to tell them anything, so tell them. You got two minutes, and I mean wax eloquent, rise, bring it to the rafters. And then at the moment of the end you say, if this is not the truth, may God strike me dead.',\n",
              " 'Well, that leads me into the filth, and, uh, to kind of wind up. Thank you. You know, that’s the trouble with it, is trying to decide what to call these words, man. I’m trying to decide what to call this whole thing. You know, what are these words that I’m talkin about, they’re just words that we’ve decided, sort of decided not to use all the time. That’s about the only thing you could really say about them for sure, that they’re just some words, not many, either, just a few, that we’ve decided well, we won’t use them all the time. Sometimes, well, hell yeah, sometimes it’s okay, but not all the time. And they’re the only words that seem to have that restriction. I mean, there are a lot of words you can say whenever you want, you know, pneumonia. Nobody gives you a lot of… all right, you can’t yell it in the hospital a great deal, but what the hell. There are words that you can say, no problem. Topography, no one has ever gone to jail for screaming topography. But there are some words that you can go to jail for. There are some words that we just have decided we will not say all the time. Sometimes, okay, if you’re running through the jungle chasing somebody that we’re at war with you can holler them. If you’re shooting a criminal it’s okay, it’s the all American thing, dirty, fucking crook. But if you’re with the bishop’s wife at lunch, it’s better not to ask for the goddamn lettuce. You know what I mean, it’s just like we’ve decided there’d be some words we won’t say all the time. And I was just trying to find out which words they were, for sure, all of them. I wanted a list. Cause nobody gives you a list, that’s the problem, they don’t give you a list. Wouldn’t you think it would be normal if they didn’t want you to say something to tell you what it is? Nobody even tells you when you’re a kid what the words are that you’re supposed to avoid. You have to say them to find out which ones they are. Shit, ahhhh. Oh fuck, ahhhh. That’s two. Oh, ma, that’s enough trial and error, huh? Please, ma, give me a list, huh? All right, you’re six years old now, and here’s the list of words your dad and I don’t ever want to hear you say. Oh, hey, thanks ma. Boy, that’s gonna save me an ass kicking or two. Ahhhh, ohhh. Yeah, you never know what’s gonna be on the list, cause it’s always somebody else’s list. You didn’t make that up, somebody told you that shit. They told you, better… better not say that, so you’re gonna… and you don’t know what’s gonna be on their list. God, people’s lists even change from day to day. Some people on Friday night got a list, you know, about two or three words. Sunday morning, goddamn, there’s 27 words on it. These are the same people, two days later, different list. So you’ve gotta kind of watch out what you’re gonna believe from them. The trouble is, I was trying to find out what these words might be, and I wanted to know the ones that you could never say on television. I mean, the filthy words that are always filthy. There are a lot of these little two-way, double entendre words that have two meanings, words that they’re okay part of the time. I call them like, part-time filth, some of these words, they’re only 50 percent dirty. You have words like ass. Ass is hardly even a dirty word anymore, but it has a few meanings that you can’t say on television, that’s what I was talking about, what can you say on television. That’s another one of those places where we can’t use these words all the time. But some of them are all right, some of the time. Ass is all right on television. You can say on television things like, well, you’ve made a perfect ass of yourself tonight. But you can’t say, hey, let’s go get some ass. Bitch, bitch is another word like that, same kind of word, it’s only dirty part of the time, depends on what you mean by bitch. You might be the lady from the San Diego Zoo visiting one of the Tonight Shows, and you might just have a bunch of little canines with you there. One of them is a female, and you say there’s the bitch, Johnny. And it’s okay, fine. Just don’t refer to the singer the same way, that’s all. Is that bitch gonna do another number? Yes. Animals are fine on those two-way words. And that’s it, that’s what I was trying to find, the words that were always dirty not just part of the time, but completely filth. Well, in… in looking for these words I kept finding new categories. We have so many ways of describing these dirty words, it’s, well, we have more ways to describe dirty words than we actually have dirty words. That seems a little strange to me. It seems to indicate that somebody was awfully interested in these words. They kept referring to them, they called them bad words, dirty, filthy, foul, vile, vulgar, coarse, in poor taste, unseemly, street talk, gutter talk, locker room language, barracks talk, bawdy, naughty, saucy, raunchy, rude, crude, lewd, lascivious, indecent, profane, obscene, blue, off-color, risque, suggestive, cursing, cussing, swearing. And all I could think of was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits, man. That’s all we have, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. That was my original list. I knew it wasn’t complete, but it was a starter set, you know? …mention WBAI? Shit, piss, fuck… yes, WBAI is the one who played them… shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. Now, that was the original list. We’ve added a few words since then, we’ve added fart, turd and twat. And I know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about, why they haven’t been considered, why they haven’t shown up on the list thus far. We’re looking at them all very closely. Some of your favorites might make the list this year; asshole, ballbag, hard on, piss hard, blue balls… nookie, snatch, box, pussy, pecker, peckerhead, peckertracks, jism, joint, donicker, dork, poontang, cornhole and dingleberry. Dingleberry, a very popular word. And to my way of thinking, dingleberry a rather innocent sounding word, dingleberry, sounds Christmasy to me, you know? Let’s put one on the tree, dad. So, the words, as I say, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Now, motherfucker came off the list immediately. The first day in fact I had a call from an English language purist, some guy had to, he had to talk, you know? He got on the phone. He tells me I have a duplicate on the list, I have a duplication. He says motherfucker is a duplication of the word fuck, technically. Because fuck is the root form, motherfucker being a derivative, therefore, it constitutes duplication. And I said, hey, motherfucker, how did you get my phone number anyway? How did he know I even had a phone? I said look, man, it may be a derivative, but you still can’t say it. You still can’t say motherfucker on TV, can you? He said no, but you can’t say fuckee, fucking, fuckola, fuckarooni or fuckarino, either. Well, I said, yeah, that would crowd up my list something awful. So I just struck that motherfucker away. I struck it from the list, motherfucker was gone. Now, the list was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Does is sound like something’s missing? Does it sound like an old friend is gone? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Remember the old rhythm? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits. Now, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits, it falls apart. It isn’t going anywhere. And by now, cocksucker is the dominant word on the list. Previously, with motherfucker on the list, cocksucker was somewhat balanced out. They were the only multi-syllabic words on the list. But now cocksucker stands alone, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits, And who knows, maybe it doesn’t belong either. After all, motherfucker turned out to be a ringer, let’s take a look at cocksucker, see if this one belongs. We’ll divide the word cock and sucker from each other, those words. Sucker isn’t dirty, sucker, it’s suggestive as hell, but it isn’t dirty. And cock, that’s not dirty all the time, that’s one of those words that’s only partly filthy. Cock, if you’re talking about the animal, it’s perfectly all right. They used to read that to us from the bible in third grade, and we would laugh, man. Cock is in the bible. Remember the first time you heard about a cock fight. What? No. Get out of here. Get out of here. Even the word cocksucker itself has been twisted out of all of its original meaning, it’s been distorted. For some reason now, cocksucker means bad man. It’s a good woman, how did they do that? How did they do that? Well, tits is on the end of the list, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits. And you know it doesn’t belong on that list. I mean, it really doesn’t belong in with that kind of heavy-weight filth. Tits isn’t dirty, tits is a cute name, cute thing, cute idea, great fun, good name. Tits, hey, tits sounds like a friend. It sounds like a nickname, doesn’t it? Hey, Tits, come here man. Hey, Tits, I want you to meet Toots. Tits, this is Toots, Toots, Tits. Tits, cute word, nice word. I love a word that spells the same forwards and backwards like tit. Don’t you think it’s cute when a word is spelled the same forwards and backwards? I always wished my name was Otto, just so I could walk backwards and yell my name, you know? Otto, Otto, Otto, well, I had strange dreams. But the word tit is on the list because you can’t say it on television. You can’t say tit, imagine that, can’t say tits. You can say boobs. Boob is spelled the same forwards and backwards, too. Boobs is all right. You can’t say tits, but you can say boobs. In fact, boobs is an answer now on Match Game. I had boobs, Gene. Boobs, $200, tits, $200 fine maybe. You can’t say tits. You can say teats, teats is all right, providing you’re on at 5:00 in the morning and a cow is your guest. But you can’t say jugs, and you can’t say knockers, you know? That’s right, Danny, pull on the cow’s knockers. Right, grab a knocker in each hand, that a boy. Now alternate knockers, good deal. You can’t say that. Tits, tits sounds like a snack, you know? Well, I know what you’re thinking, but tits sounds almost, it sounds Nabisco to me. It sounds like Nabisco has… has reserved that name. Cause tits sounds like a thing at a party, pass the tits, would you, Bill? Say, those things are… responding. Well, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Fart, fart is like tit, it’s one of those words that isn’t that harmful. You know, it’s just a cute kind of a thing. Farts, well, farts can be a little harmful, it depends, it depends on who’s cooking. But, fart, fart is a cute… hey kids know farts are okay. Kids know farts are fun. Farts are shit without the mess, wow. Yeah, same funny sound, same vile smell, no fuss, no muss. Fart is an interesting word in this respect, talking about television, fart is extremely interesting because, dig this, you can’t say fart on television, we know that. You can’t say fart. And you can’t say fuck, either, on television. However, you can refer to fucking, you can talk about fucking, they do that all the time. Some of the times in the show you’re watching two people are probably fucking in the other room. Fucking is all right, fucking is part of the plot. A lot of plots are based on fucking. Will they fuck, should they fuck, have they fucked, did they fuck, will they fuck again, will they get sick from fucking, are they fucking too much, will they fuck each other’s friends, will they have a baby from fucking, will they be sorry they fucked, will they be glad they fucked? All fuck stories, every honeymoon joke is a fuck joke. Have you ever noticed it? Otherwise the people wouldn’t be on their honeymoon in the joke, they’d be knights or they’d sailors or something. They’re on their honeymoon, it’s got to be a fuck joke. Every little, every news… I’m sorry… every quiz master has stood there with his newlywed couple and said, and I understand you folks are on your honeymoon. Lots of fucking going on here, Lots of fucking over here. So they talk about fucking all they want, they just don’t call it that. They don’t call it what it is. They call it other things, they call it making love, which is fine, they call it going to bed with someone, having an affair, sleeping together, but they don’t call it fucking. On the other hand, fart, not only is fart a word you can’t use on television, but they never even refer to them, that’s how bad farts are compared to fucking. They don’t even refer to farts, there are no farts on television. You’ve never seen a reference to a fart, I’ve never seen a fart reference. No, wouldn’t you think that by now one guy would have gone, whew, whew. Do you think by now that one guy on the Johnny Carson panel just once would have said, hey, Ed, move down, man? Whew, wow. That was a Clydesdale fart, Ed. Give me the lighter, will ya, Johnny, wow. Geez, Ed, next time you’re sick you ought to see the nurse, you know? God, it’s not the smell so much, it’s the burning of my eyes. Well, we might live to see that, you never know. Remember when you were a kid, and maybe you were a little boy child like me, you had on short pants, maybe sitting in church, sitting on a wooden bench in church in the middle of the summer with short pants. You gotta fart, you know? And it’s up to you, you gotta work out a little maneuver that’s called the one cheek sneak. Right in tune with the organ. That’s why they call them pews, you know? Whew, whew, whew. Did you ever notice that your own farts smell okay? Say, that’s fairly decent. I think I’ll stay home today, do some reading in the closet. Now I mentioned the three extra words, fart, turd and twat. Turd is another word you can’t say on television, turd. But, you know, when you get right down to it, who wants to say it? I don’t even care if I ever hear that one again. Twat, twat is on the list for the same reason. It doesn’t mean anything else, you know? It only has that one meaning, twat’s twat, and that’s that. It’s not like prick, prick is one of those part-time dirty words. Prick is all right, you can say prick on television. You can say I pricked my finger, just don’t say you fingered your prick, that’s all. Now there are two words left which I will wind this thing up with, one of them is not, uh, dirty all the time, one of them is. Ball or balls is a word that’s mostly clean. It has many clean meanings, but… but it has a couple of meanings that might get you in trouble. And ball is one of those words you gotta think about how you’re gonna say it, and maybe you have to watch out for just a moment, but it’s okay for sports people, perfectly all right. When you’re a kid you grow up, they tell ya, go play with your ball. Really? But it’s okay for the sports announcer on the Game of the Week to tell you that Pete Rose has two balls on him, no problem at all. The whole country nods in agreement. But the announcer can’t tell you that he hurt his balls. He can’t tell Tony Kubeck, Tony, I think he hurt his balls on that play. It looks like it, he’s holding onto them. Well, that’s right, generally when they hurt their balls, they hold them, and he’s holding his, and I’d say he’s hurt them. Never mention ball injuries, they don’t say the balls were hurt, they say groin injuries. He had a groin injury. Do you know why we call it a groin injury, that’s the noise you make when you get hit there. Groin. Now, then, the other word I wanted to remind you of was the word fuck, which of course is the champ of the all-time dirty words. When they’re always dirty, by God, fuck is right at the head of the pack. Fuck’s a good, strong word. It’s a good, strong word for its purpose, and it’s a word that a lot of people have trouble with. Uh, it’s a… it’s an honest word, it’s a… it’s a forceful word, it has a lot of emotional baggage with it. When you hear the word fuck, you’re not just hearing the word, you’re hearing everything you ever heard about fucking. I mean, we have a lot of attitudes about fucking, some of them are rationale, and some of them aren’t. Some of them have joy in them, some have guilt and fear and all sorts of things, and the word fuck carries with it a lot of emotional baggage. When they say fuck. You go what, oh, oh, good. Oh, I thought you meant do it right away. God, you know, it’s, uh, it’s just a word that, that, well, it’ll clear the room awfully quick in some households. It’s a heavy, good, strong word. It’s a proud sounding word to me. Fuck, fuck, I am fuck. Who are you? Fuck of the Mountain. I just, uh, I just feel the word is getting a bad shake. The word has an image problem. The word fuck needs public relations help. It’s just a word, you know? That’s what you have to remember, it’s just a word, but it’s in such bad shape. Here’s a word that started out okay, it started out all right, nothing wrong with the word fuck originally. I mean, there it was, you’re not a bad word, you’re not a bad word, you’ve just gotten in with bad company, people. That’s all, just the word was all it was. The word in the original old English, as best I can find, fuck only meant to hit, to smite, to… to perhaps hit with a stick, to fuck the tree, to fuck the rock, to fuck thee. That’s all, and pretty soon, that’s all, I’ll hit you with my dick, honey. Look at that, that’s all it was, just a little, I’ll knock a little fuck on you there. That’s all it was, was a love tap when you get right down to it. That’s all fuck ever meant. All fuck ever meant was to make love, and to make life at the same time. That’s pretty magic. I mean, pretty noble things we think about, making love and making life, here was fuck hanging around with words like love and life. How did it get such a bad reputation? We fucked it up. Yeah, well, we… we put the aggression back into the word. Fuck you, fuck you, you fuck. Fuck you, you fuck. Who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with, some kind of a fuckhead? Fuck you. Who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with, me? Don’t fuck with me, I’ll fuck over you. You fuck with me and you’ll get fucked, you fuck. Don’t fuck with me, I’m the fucker. Don’t fuck with the fucker. God, it sounds like combat, man. It’s got an awful lot, there’s an awful lot of hostility in the way that word is used. There’s an awful lot of aggression going down in the name of fucking, imagine that. I’d just like to help a little, my feeling was, hey, here’s a word that, uh, maybe we could save, you know, just by paying a little close attention to it. The trouble is with all that aggression and all that violence, that we lose track of those two things, and people start talking about sex and violence like they’re one thing. There’s some sort of an overlapping, there’s some sort of a gray area between sex and violence that some people really are confused about. There are people running around talking about sex and violence as if it’s one thing, as if it starts with an S and ends with a E. We’re gonna stamp it out of the comics, we’re gonna stamp it out of the Dixie Cup, we’re gonna stamp it out of homes. Sex and violence, hey, they are different, after all. And, some people even like them together, there are, true, people who do like a little violence with their sex. I’m not… I don’t care for that myself, I like my violence a little earlier in the afternoon, you know? Right around 2:00 o’clock a real good ass kicking and then everything’s all right. But, uh, the word make love, not war, someone pointed it out finally, they made it very clear for us. Make love, not war. I wish I had thought of that phrase, you know? I really would have been very happy with myself if I had thought of that one. Man, I would have retired the same day. I would have left my car at the red light, man. I’d say that’s it, folks, I’m going to the beach. You got it, make love, not war. Well, I didn’t think of it, but I do have my own phrase; make fuck, not kill. It’s not as graceful a phrase, but I’m not looking to retire, either. The whole idea of make fuck, not kill, is simply to switch the meanings of the words. I suggest that for one year we trade meanings on fuck and kill, just fuck for kill, and kill for fuck, that’s it. Don’t worry about what they really are, someone else will take care of real fucking and real killing. I’m just worried about what we call it… them. We call them fucking and killing. I say switch them around. I think it would be an insight, I think we’d get a new slant on how we feel about these words if we just change fucking for killing for about a year, that’s all. Imagine it. Sure would be fun watching TV during that time, huh? Better get down off the horse, Sheriff, we’re fixing to fuck you now. Mad fucker still on the loose. Not anymore, he’s made his first big mistake, my friend, he fucked a cop today. That makes him a cop fucker. Pardon me, boys, my horse broke his leg, I’m gonna have to fuck him, I’ll be right back. Shamu, the fucker whale. And To Fuck a Mockingbird, hold gently by the wings. So all I’m trying to suggest is that fuck you can be a positive phrase. If you hear it from across the street… Fuck you. Okay.',\n",

              " 'Hi, this is George Carlin, and I thought we might take a look at some of the pictures from the days when my show business career was just starting. This is one of the earliest photos of my days as an actor. Here I’m playing the part of a baby in an early production of a play called “Hold Onto The Rail.” As proof of the intensity I brought to the role, lying nearby you can see a doll that I had recently strangled. This is a candid photo of my first manager and I having a business conference in the park, where we knew we couldn’t be bugged. In this photo I am trying out a new funny face that I had been working on for about six months. Now, here I am with, uh, two of my fellow actors from the West Harlem production of either Ben Hur or the Sound of Music. You can’t really tell from what we’re wearing there because those are our street clothes. And the person off to one side is our personal manager who insisted on being in all of our publicity photos. This is a rare photo, uh, this is a photo of me in a singing group called The Mills Brothers. Uh, we didn’t know that there was already a group in existence by that name. The Mills Brothers sued us, so we dropped two guys and changed the named to Mickey and Sylvia. This is a picture of the time I came in second in a suntan contest. The boy in the middle won, but it was, uh, later he was disqualified when it was discovered he had been using pep pills. Uh, this is the same photo with the negative reversed. As you can see, the suntans are approximately the same on the back. This is me during an early suicide attempt. I was despondent at that time because my puberty was coming along very slowly. This one was taken during the nationwide search for a replacement for Lassie. I remember this picture. I’m trying to get my dog Spotty, a fox terrier, to stand up straight and act like a collie. Uh, although he didn’t get the part, later he did go on to become Mars the Cat God, rest his soul’s manager. This is a picture of me and the boy who doubled for me during my early film career. Normally I did all my own stunts except for the scenes involving homosexuality, of course, and this boy served that purpose. This is me singing in a trio I had started which was called The Inkspots. Oddly enough, the NAACP sued the trio and forced me to drop out when I couldn’t prove there was such a thing as flesh colored ink. This is my first communion picture. It was so well received that I decided to use it for publicity, and to this day, this is the picture that I send out when producers call and ask me if I’m interested in serious acting.',\n",
              " 'And that brings me to today, here in Phoenix, Arizona, where we’re going to shoot one of these comedy shows for the first time in the round. So I’ll see you around. All right, now, I’m starting to feel it Marty. Let’s go, Marty. All right. No, I want to do like, this is what guys who run do, sprinters do this, 60-yard dash. I always wonder if they’re gonna run on their fingers or what. Okay, getting ready to go. Hey, how are you there? Okay, we’re getting ready to go. We’re getting ready. All right, we’re going to hire you on good judge of character. Hi, how are you? Looks like you made it all the way out to the van during half-time. That’s good. Any time. What? Go. I can go out, on-stage? Yeah. Oh, all right. Ah, yes, thank you. Thank you. Very nice, thank you very much. Well, thank you. Well, I do thank you. And you all got here. Imagine that, we all got here. That’s what always knocks me out about the audience, the audience comes from everywhere. Audiences come from all different houses, different apartments, all over town, different rooms. Imagine that, you had to leave your room and come on to the theater. Maybe you had to drive here, that’s how a lot of us got here. You had to get in and drive the big iron thing, trying real hard not to hit anyone else in the other big iron things. But we got here. Now, all we have to do is get back again. I do think about the audience, though, I’m in the audience, too. You know, I mean, I feel like I’m in the audience, I just happen to have the best seat in the house, that’s all. I am in the audience, and I know the things you think of. I think of them too. When I’m driving to the theater going to be in the audience I’m thinking to myself, what kind of a member of the audience will I be tonight? Will I be a credit to my row? Will we win row of the year? Suppose we get some shit from another section? If there’s a fire drill, will I file out safely, or trample the shit out of my neighbor? Pardon me, fire, look out, fire, pardon me, fire, fire, look out, pardon me, fire. We never practice that one, do we, panicking. We never practice panicking, we practice going out neatly, pardon me, fire, look out, pardon me, fire, fire, yeah, pardon me, fire. We never do that, I don’t know why we practice so much.

              " 'I wonder, I wonder a lot of things. I wonder what it’s like when I’m not there. Do you wonder what it’s like when you’re not there anymore, when you’re gone? You know, you were somewhere, you were over here with your friends and you’re talking some shit with them. You say we’ll see you later, Phil, we’re going downtown, and then you leave. Do you wonder what it’s like over there now? I wonder are they gonna treat me right while I’m gone? What’s it like? I wonder a lot of things, but that’s my job. My job is thinking up goofy shit. You know, that’s my job, thinking up goofy shit. My job is to think up stuff and come around and remind you of it. Cause you already knew it, you just forgot to laugh at it, that’s all. My job to remind you. I wonder about things like, I wonder if on a rainy night the sandman sends the mudman. You’d think it would be his job. I wonder why we don’t have any large craft warnings. Apparently we don’t care about the big boats, huh? I wonder why Marineland doesn’t have a display of fish sticks. I mean, it’s a seafood, I’d like to see it. In fact, I’d like to see Mrs. Paul herself come swimming by. Hi, boys. I wonder if a centipede wants to kick another centipede in the shins, does he kick one leg at a time, or does he stand on 50 and kick with 50? I wonder why there are not waiters in waiting rooms. They’re all in the restaurant. I wonder why women wear evening gowns to nightclubs. Why don’t they wear nightgowns? And I wonder why fluorescent lights seem afraid to come on. Have you ever noticed, you turn them on and they go blip, blip, blip, blip, blip… finally they’ll come on after you coax them a little. I wonder why Kleenex doesn’t have a target in the middle of it. Don’t you think we need a bulls-eye right in the middle of the Kleenex? I wonder about hats. Did you ever notice that when you have a hat on for a long time, it feels like it’s not there. And then when you take it off, it feels like it’s still there. That’s creepy. I wonder about frog’s legs. In those restaurants where they serve frog’s legs, what do they do with the rest of the frog? What, do they just throw it away? I mean, they don’t have frog torsos on the menu. They must be doing something with them. They throw them away. Can you imagine a barrel full of frog bodies in the restaurant and some drunk coming down the alley, oh, goddamn. I wouldn’t wanna see that. I wonder about who empties wishing wells. Who the hell empties the wishing wells? That’s our money. I’ve never seen an accounting. Does anybody ever tell you, no, gone, just gone. Someone picked it up, someone emptied the well. I’m sure they don’t come around at 3:00 in the afternoon on Sunday with a little girl in her first communion dress dropping a dime. 3:00 in the morning, black T-shirts empty the wishing well. It’s our money and I want some of it back. I wonder if movie directors have credits on their dreams. And I wonder why there’s no blue food. Where the hell is the blue food? Every other food is represented… I mean, every other color, every other color is represented. I mean, every color… okay, red is raspberry, cherry and strawberry, orange is orange, yellow is lemon, green is lime, brown is meat. There’s no blue food. Why the hell was blue left out of the food thing? Somebody’s got the blue food, goddammit. Somebody’s got it. It probably bestows immortality, that’s why we haven’t been given any. And don’t say blueberries, we know they’re purple. You look at a blueberry and you see that sucker is purple. Bleu cheese, no, bleu cheese is just white cheese with a bunch of mold in it, man. And bluefish, God knows, you open one up they’re every color under the sun. Well, enough of that shit. I wonder, I wonder which came first, skilled workers or unskilled, and who decided? I figure originally all we had was workers, and then they decided, this is hard. And they called themselves skilled. And someone else came along they couldn’t do it, poor unskilled son of a bitch. They moved right past his ass, man, when he was just in the landing area. Do you think maybe Charlie McCarthy has little wooden balls? I’ve always wondered that. Hi, Charlie, hi, Charlie. You know what I wonder about, I wonder we buy flowers. Why do we buy flowers? They’re free. They grow all over. Yet, we buy them, we pay good money for flowers, flowers that are dying, I might add. That’s a little strange, flowers is one, flowers is one of the few things that you buy, you bring it to your house, and if they die you don’t give a shit. Normally, you’d be asking for your money back on anything that died. Are you kidding me, these things keeled over on the piano. Flowers. I wonder why I’ve never seen anyone cleaning a church. Have you? I’ve never seen someone cleaning a church. A lot of things go on in church. You never see a cleaning crew going in there with pails and mops and shit. It just never happens. Why don’t they clean churches? You know why? Churches don’t need to be cleaned, they clean themselves overnight. That’s how they know they’re churches. Come back the next morning, shit, it’s still clean, must be a church.',\n",
              " 'Does the time bother you? I get bothered by the time. Not so much the time itself, the people bother me for the time. People come up to me on the street, I’m sure you’ve had this happen to you, people come up to you and say what time it is, or they might say what time is it? I shouldn’t get into these ballads. You’ve had people come up to you and say, what time is it? What time is it? As if you personally were responsible for keeping time. You know, I feel, I feel honored, first of all, that they thought I was the man in charge. But I do have to explain, you don’t see official timekeeper on here, do you? I don’t have the time of course not. Do you have the time? That’s another way they say it, do you have the time? I say, uh, no, I don’t believe I do. I certainly didn’t have it this morning. Did you leave it somewhere? Well, do you have the time? No, I don’t have the time. I use a little of it like everyone, you know, but I don’t have it. I think, I think the Navy has it, in Washington. Isn’t that, they keep it in an observatory, that’s right. Sure, they let out a little of it each day. Not too much, they wouldn’t want to give us too much, just enough time. Sometimes they’ll say, do you know what time it is? And I say, yes. I hate to disappoint them, but there is no time. There is no time. I don’t mean there’s no time, I mean there’s no time. When the hell is it? We made that whole thing up. There’s no time, we made it up. It’s a manmade invention, time. There are no numbers up in the sky. I’ve looked, they’re not there. We made this stuff up, when is it? When the hell is it, when are we, I ask you, when are we? Sometimes we think we know where we are, but we don’t really know when we are. When the hell is it? All the time zones are different, every calendar you run across is different. They’ll all give you a different answer. These are calendars, these are made to… to keep track of time. Everybody’s got a different one. The Chinese are way up there in the 5 and 6000’s, Hebrew calendar is way up in the 5 and 6000’s, we’re up at about 1977. Well, shit, this ain’t a couple of weeks these people are off, this is thousands of goddamn years that are missing, man. How did they do that? We don’t, we don’t know when the hell is it, it could be the middle of last month, for all we know. I mean, time is so, we’ve got it down so perfect that every four years we have to stick in an extra day just to make sure it still works, and we call it February 29th. Bullshit, it’s March 1st and I know it. It just feels like March 1st. You can’t keep track of the time, what’s the sense. Give you an example, there’s a moment coming, it’s not here yet, it’s still on the way, it’s in the future, it hasn’t arrived, here it comes, here it is, oh, shit, it’s gone. There’s no now, there’s no now, everything is the near future or the recent past. But there’s no present. Welcome to the present, whoosh, gone again. It’s just so imprecise. We don’t even care to use the minutes and seconds and hours that we’ve been given, everybody’s very vague about the time. They say what time you got, I got, uh, I got just after. Just after, geez, I must be slow, I had going on. And where did that imprecision begin? Why is it we’re not so sure? I know one of the clues that happened to me was when they started telling me about moments when I was a kid. They were trying to teach me how to tell time, and of course, you can’t tell time, time tells you. But they were trying, they were trying to show me. Now the big hand, I said I don’t have a big hand. Never mind, look at the clock. And the clock is so wonderful, there’s so much emotion attached to a clock face. I hate digital clocks. Digital clocks rob me of all the emotional experience of the spatial relationships on that face of the clock. Isn’t it true, I mean, don’t you always feel that this half hour when it comes down from 12 down to 6 goes by a lot quicker than this half hour when it has to come up fighting gravity all the way? I know, it does go a lot quicker, yeah. Oh, I got ya, yeah. I’ll tell ya, I’ll tell ya this, if I only have a half to live, I want it to be this one, man. I wanna last just a little bit longer than this one here. It’s vague, that’s all I’m saying, it’s very vague how we treat time. We have all these wonderful expressions, we say now, now is an interesting one. When, now, you want that now? Yes. Well, would you like to try again. Or sometimes just now, just now, did you hear that? What? Just now. You must mean just then, don’t you? Yes, just then, but there it goes again. When? – Now? – No, not now. Pardon me, do you have the time? When do you mean, now or when you asked me? This shit is moving, Ruth. We got a lot of these vague terms, right away, immediately, at once, lickety split, just like that, nothing flat, drop of a hat, no time at all, as quick as you can say Jack Robinson. I’m sure you’ve done that to people, I’ll be back before you can say Jack Robinson. Jack Robinson, you’re not back. How about, a jiffy, a jiffy, or a flash? Which is quicker? A jiffy or a flash? I think there are two flashes in a jiffy, myself. But God knows how many jiffies there are in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. And why did they use two shakes of a lamb’s tail, what’s wrong with the basic unit of measurement, one shake of a lamb’s tail? We can do our own arithmetic, thank you. Belched a little there. Tried to swallow that one. Then we have words like soon. Soon, that’s a very emotional word, there’s a lot of potential for drama in that word, soon. Soon, soon, is your mother coming home? Uh-huh. When? Soon. Real soon. As soon as she can. Sooner than you think, that’s kind of a spooky one, Sooner than I think? That’s a little bit like before you know it. I’ll be back before you know it. He did it, holy Christ, look at that. And we go on with these terms that we use, these vague terms of time, one of these days, before long, any time now. Well, that’s true, everything is gonna happen any time now. Any day now, that’s kind of a snotty one, any day now. Hey, I’ll be giving you that five bucks I owe you, Bill. Yeah, any day now. Sooner or later, now and then, once in a while, from time to time, in a little while. In a little while, that will just be a little while. That’s a wonderful one, and I just love that. It sounds so benign, just a little while. Couldn’t hurt you, could it? You can wait a little while. It’ll only be a little while longer, just a little while. That’s so different from a short time. Short time sounds sound almost terminal, doesn’t it? You only have a short time. Whereas you have a little while. Oh, I’d rather have a little while than a short time. You know, we’ve got long ways we measure time, we’ve got vast distances of time we measure. People will say things like kingdom come, I’m… I’m gonna be standing here till kingdom come. Shit, I don’t have that on my watch. Doomsday, you say? Doomsday. Till the cows come home. Now, that’s an easy one to understand, that’s long about dusk, isn’t it? If you leave them out overnight they’d burst. Here’s a long period of time, forever. Some people will tell you, gosh, I’ve been standing on this line forever. Look at this, Dave, this man has been standing on line forever. He looks fairly fresh to me. Almost like an eternity, people will tell you, it’s… it’s almost like an eternity, as if they had experience with eternities. Now, you must have a favorite period of time. I have some favorites, I just want to try a few of them on you. It isn’t easy, uh, to select a favorite period of time, so many of them are attractive, but there are little periods of time that, um, that you might relate to. Of course, the most basic period of time I feel is five minutes. That seems to be the one everyone chooses. If they need to think of a period of time real quickly, they just go five minutes, just five minutes, I’ll be there in just five minutes, give me five minutes, would you please just, would you just give me five minutes? Are you kidding me, I can fix that shit in five minutes. Five minutes, that’s all most people want, five minutes, a good, solid, nice period of time. You can do anything for five minutes, can’t you? I mean anything. Even things you really hate. Yeah, you can probably do it for five minutes. Hey, let’s go talk to Ted. Are you kidding? Ted’s an asshole. Look, just five minutes, huh? Okay, let’s give him five minutes. Not ten, ten I can’t make, now you’re getting into double digits, you’re starting to fool with my head. Time, five, ten minutes. Fifteen minutes is popular, you hear fifteen quite a bit. But it’s, it’s sort of an institutional one, it’s kind of an official time period, 15 minutes. Has a touch of regulatory, uh, quality to it, doesn’t it? It sounds like something you’re not supposed to do, or have to do for 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes. I like 20 minutes. Doesn’t that sound free compared to 15, 15 minutes? Twenty minutes. I’ll be back in 20 minutes. Gosh, what’s he gonna do?',\n",
              " 'Do you have those news stories for me? Maybe let’s go to the news reports, man. Tell us what’s going on around the world. God knows you’re not home to find out.

Would you hold that for me. Oh, hey, now I need it, now I need it. It’s like starting a fire for the charcoal burner, you know? God, well, that’s gonna be nice, That’ll really… Well, anyway, would you hold them both for me. Now you’re under arrest. Here comes the Wisine, as we say, in the middle part of Europe. Well, there ain’t much of this left, but there is one final story that I would like to wind up with, folks, and I do thank you for that Visine, but I didn’t smoke at half-time, so if they’re red, it’s just natural eyeball blood pressure, or whatever you call that shit. I was, the one you were gonna moan about, I was gonna tell a man… about a man who was scheduled for a heart transplant who decided not to have it. He had a change of heart, you know? I love that shit, that’s why… I know why you’re moaning, because you wish you had thought of the goddamn thing yourself. I have to think that. Like to wind up the news tonight with sort of a little story, kind of a human interest story about man’s best friend. It seems that 65-year-old James Driscoll was asleep in his downtown hotel room last Wednesday when he was awakened by the sound of a dog barking. When he woke, he found the room was full of smoke, he could not see, and the dog led him out of the room, down the hall, and into an elevator shaft where he plunged eight stories to his death.',\n",
              " 'I want to do a… a nostalgic thing here for my own sake and for the request of a couple of people that are on the crew that are listening or looking through viewers, or listening on headsets or whatever, and do a little, uh, weather forecast from Al Sleet, Al Sleet, the hippy-dippy weatherman. Hey, baby, what’s happening. Que pasa? Que what you call your pasa? Al Sleet here, your hippy-dippy weatherman, with all the hippy-dippy weather, man. Brought to you by Parson’s Pest Control. Do you have termites, waterbugs and roaches? Well, Parson’s will help you get rid of the termites and waterbugs, and help you smoke the roaches. Hey. Temperature at the airport is 88 degrees, which is stupid, man, cause I don’t know anybody who lives at the airport. Now if you’ll take a look at our national weather map, you’ll see that we don’t have one. So try to picture last night’s map in your mind. Remember all the letters and lines, all them little numbers. The weather is dominated by a large Canadian low, which is not to be confused with a Mexican high. Tonight’s forecast, dark, continued dark tonight, turning to partly light in the morning. Old Al, Al got out of the weather business and he’s, uh, he’s now a, a linoleum, uh, quality control inspector in a linoleum plant. Al, he only wanted to get out of the media. You know, he said fuck it, I don’t need it. And, uh, hey, who can blame him. I don’t know, but Al got out of weather when he realized he had given the… the final weather forecast. He had given the ultimate forecast, there was nowhere to go. You know, when there’s nothing left to conquer in your field, hey, it’s time to leave. And old Al had given the ultimate forecast, he told us, he said one night that the weather will continue to change on and off for a long, long time. Then he was gone from it. God bless Al.',\n",
              " 'Okay. Yes, you’re all, you’re all going to die. Didn’t mean to remind you of it, but it is on your schedule. Yes, it probably won’t happen when you want. It usually comes along when you’re not expecting. Generally you have your stamp collection out, you know? Now? Now. Just want a little time to put away your hinges, you know? No, there’s a time to die, and it’s okay, you know? It’s really okay. Nobody wants to die, nobody. Well, you know, ha ha, most people don’t wanna die. Nobody wants to die. Boy, if you think being sick is no fun, dying is really a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to die. People don’t mind being dead, being dead is great, but getting dead, nobody wants to get dead. So I hope I don’t die. I wonder how often we think that, you know? It’s just under the surface, isn’t it? You go out for the day, going out of your house, geez, I hope I don’t die. It would really spoil the circus if I were to die. Geez, I hope I don’t die. Comedians don’t wanna die. It’s only a metaphor, but it’s true of all of us, we don’t wanna die out there. A comic’s gonna die, I don’t want to die. Geez, I was dying out there, I was dying, it was death out there. It was like a morgue. I don’t wanna die. Of course, if the comedian doesn’t die, you know? If he succeeds, if he makes you laugh, then he can say, I killed ’em. I killed ’em. So, it’s either me or you, you know, just like on the freeway. Yeah, dying shouldn’t be that bad, it shouldn’t be that bad. We’re all gonna do it, it’s one of the few fair things in life, everybody catches it once. And dying should be fun, there should be some sort of a look ahead. I mean, after all, when you die you’re gonna find out where you go. Haven’t we been wondering about that a long time, where the hell we go. Isn’t that the biggest thing we have to wonder about, where the hell do you go? I don’t know. Joe thinks he knows. I know Joe thinks he knows, but Joe don’t know. Where do we go? Nobody knows. Well, I think sometimes you go where you think you’re gonna go, whatever you think you’re gonna do, that’s where you’re probably gonna go. If you keep saying you’re gonna go somewhere, chances are you might go there. You ever hear those guys say, I’m going to hell, don’t pray for me. Don’t pray for me, I’m going to hell. He is. You go where you wanna go. I think when you die, your soul goes to a garage in Buffalo. When Monte Hall dies, he’ll go behind Door Number 4. That’s it, where you wanna go. No, nobody wants to die, and you know part of the reason we don’t wanna die is because of that goddamn funeral. We’ve seen it, we know how bad news it is. That funeral is no fun. Man, if I don’t like other people’s funerals, I know I’m not gonna like my own, man. There’s no way I can get behind my own funeral. Gonna be lying there in a casket, they’re gonna put me in the box, gonna put me in a convertible with the top down. You know that’s embarrassing, lying there and everybody’s looking at you. You’re dead, and they’re looking. You’re just lying there still, people coming over going… they don’t know that you’re lying there with short pants on and no back in your jacket, embarrassing. And sometimes they’ll come over, you know, some people it depends on your religion and so forth, but they do come right over to the casket a lot of times and they’ll go like this. And they’re silent for a moment, and what they’re doing while they’re silent is, they’re subtracting their age from your age, so they get a rough estimate on what they have left. And they get up and they say, don’t he look good? Don’t he look good? You crazy, he’s dead. I know, but he never looked that good. Well, they say the nicest things about you, they say the nicest things when you die. Your popularity goes straight up when you die. They say the greatest things there are that can be said, they’ll even make stuff up if they have to. Well, he was a real asshole, but he meant well, you know? He was a well-meaning asshole. Yes, you get so popular when you die, all the flowers you get, think of the flowers you get when you die. You get more flowers when you die than you got in your whole life. All your flowers arrive at once, too late. And guys will say, oh, yeah, well, you know Bill is dead, yeah, poor Bill, poor Bill is dead, yeah. Poor Dave, yeah, poor Dave is gone now. Ed, yeah, poor Ed is gone. Dan, that motherfucker is still alive, isn’t he? I wish he would die so I could like him. Reincarnation is another aspect of death that a lot of people will tell you little tales about it. Reincarnation, coming back, a lot of folks are sure of it, they can come back, you come back as something. I don’t know, does it seem right to you that it would work? I mean, mathematically, it doesn’t seem to work, because originally on this earth we only had, well, let’s say six people. I know we had two, but it’s a controversial number. Let’s say at one time there were only, there were only six of us, about, six people, six souls. And those six people died, and those souls went back to the staging area, and new people were born and those six souls came back. We still only have six souls. Now, we have four billion people claiming to have souls. Where are all these extra souls coming from? Someone is printing up souls, and it lowers their value. The more souls there are, the less they’re worth, it would seem. Well, somebody’s got to think of this shit, you know? How about the perfect murder, I’ve thought sometimes about the perfect murder. You know what you do, you pick up one person by the ankles and you beat another person to death with him. And they both die, and there’s no murder weapon, hey. What happened here, sergeant? Looks like a pedestrian accident to me. They must have been moving at quite a clip. Of course, if you should be caught with this perfect murder in progress, or even after the fact, if you should be caught you might wind up on death row. Death row, wow. That’s more than just fun, ain’t it? I mean, there’s cats there, death row, man, shit. Oh, well, you got that one meal, but that’s not much of a consolation, is it? You’re gonna get to order your meal, big deal. Why don’t you leave me alone, I’m not hungry, man. They give you that one last meal. I say, you can have some fun with that last meal. I mean, if you work it right. They gotta give you whatever you want. I mean, short of elephant steak, you know? They don’t wanna start on a new elephant just for one guy. But they gotta give you pretty much what you want, that’s part of the humanity of what they’re going to do to you. Yeah, you could just order something, you know, like maybe, well, shit, you tell them you can’t decide. That’s it, I can’t decide. I don’t know, I don’t know if I want steak or lobster, you know? I mean, I really love them both and I honestly can’t decide. Could they kill you? I don’t think they could kill you if you honestly couldn’t decide. Lie detector, truth serum, the man honestly doesn’t know what he wants. We can’t very well kill him, we can’t drag him down the last mile screaming, I don’t know what I want. You gotta give him a chance, and then he… well, man lives. Imagine if you worked it out and you kept it going six months, man is still alive, can’t decide on meal. Three years, eight years, and then finally you’re an honest person so you tell them when you do figure it out, and you say I’ve decided what I’d like, I think I’ll have steak. Okay, how did you want that? Oh. Well, my feeling is, if you’re gonna die, you know, or if you know, hey, die big. Die big. Nobody wants to just pass away. You don’t want to be a euphemism, do you? Nobody wants to pass away. You know, Arnie passed away. Oh, really? Yes. Well, I didn’t know that. Well, that’s the idea. On the other hand, Dave died. Oh, yes, I heard about Dave dying. That’s true. I say die big, give it a shot, man, go out big, it’s your chance. Die big, work in a few posthumous reflexes for your friends. Give them a show before you go. Entertain and uplift and instruct those you are leaving behind. When you die, give them a few posthumous reflexes. You know, the body does store electricity up, there’s a certain storage of electricity, and even a dead body, a corpse, will occasionally go (sound). And I say if you have that potential after you’re dead, use it properly. Pre-program, before you die, pre-program some posthumous reflexes that will be entertaining to those you’ve left behind. Do something to capture their imagination, roll over on the autopsy table. That’s nice. Cross your legs, scratch your balls, do something. Now, the only reason, the only reason that I even suggest that you have a choice about what you can do at the moment of death, is a very little known and very little understood part of the death process called the two-minute warning. Many people are not aware of it at all, the two-minute warning. Just as in football, two minutes before you die you receive an audible warning, two minutes, get your shit together. The reason we don’t know about it is because the only people who hear it, die. And I don’t think we’d believe someone anyway if he told us he’d received his two-minute warning, would you? Some asshole on the bus, hey, I just got my two-minute warning. You’d think it was a coach out on the town, you know? But no, the two-minute warning does arrive, and I say use that time to entertain, to leave something behind. Do something with the two minutes, hey, if nothing else give a speech, a little two-minute speech. We can all give a little two-minute speech. Just pick some subject you’re very fond of and talk about it for two minutes, I mean, tell them. It’s your last chance to tell them anything, so tell them. You got two minutes, and I mean wax eloquent, rise, bring it to the rafters. And then at the moment of the end you say, if this is not the truth, may God strike me dead.',\n",
              " 'Well, that leads me into the filth, and, uh, to kind of wind up. Thank you. You know, that’s the trouble with it, is trying to decide what to call these words, man. I’m trying to decide what to call this whole thing. You know, what are these words that I’m talkin about, they’re just words that we’ve decided, sort of decided not to use all the time. That’s about the only thing you could really say about them for sure, that they’re just some words, not many, either, just a few, that we’ve decided well, we won’t use them all the time. Sometimes, well, hell yeah, sometimes it’s okay, but not all the time. And they’re the only words that seem to have that restriction. I mean, there are a lot of words you can say whenever you want, you know, pneumonia. Nobody gives you a lot of… all right, you can’t yell it in the hospital a great deal, but what the hell. There are words that you can say, no problem. Topography, no one has ever gone to jail for screaming topography. But there are some words that you can go to jail for. There are some words that we just have decided we will not say all the time. Sometimes, okay, if you’re running through the jungle chasing somebody that we’re at war with you can holler them. If you’re shooting a criminal it’s okay, it’s the all American thing, dirty, fucking crook. But if you’re with the bishop’s wife at lunch, it’s better not to ask for the goddamn lettuce. You know what I mean, it’s just like we’ve decided there’d be some words we won’t say all the time. And I was just trying to find out which words they were, for sure, all of them. I wanted a list. Cause nobody gives you a list, that’s the problem, they don’t give you a list. Wouldn’t you think it would be normal if they didn’t want you to say something to tell you what it is? Nobody even tells you when you’re a kid what the words are that you’re supposed to avoid. You have to say them to find out which ones they are. Shit, ahhhh. Oh fuck, ahhhh. That’s two. Oh, ma, that’s enough trial and error, huh? Please, ma, give me a list, huh? All right, you’re six years old now, and here’s the list of words your dad and I don’t ever want to hear you say. Oh, hey, thanks ma. Boy, that’s gonna save me an ass kicking or two. Ahhhh, ohhh. Yeah, you never know what’s gonna be on the list, cause it’s always somebody else’s list. You didn’t make that up, somebody told you that shit. They told you, better… better not say that, so you’re gonna… and you don’t know what’s gonna be on their list. God, people’s lists even change from day to day. Some people on Friday night got a list, you know, about two or three words. Sunday morning, goddamn, there’s 27 words on it. These are the same people, two days later, different list. So you’ve gotta kind of watch out what you’re gonna believe from them. The trouble is, I was trying to find out what these words might be, and I wanted to know the ones that you could never say on television. I mean, the filthy words that are always filthy. There are a lot of these little two-way, double entendre words that have two meanings, words that they’re okay part of the time. I call them like, part-time filth, some of these words, they’re only 50 percent dirty. You have words like ass. Ass is hardly even a dirty word anymore, but it has a few meanings that you can’t say on television, that’s what I was talking about, what can you say on television. That’s another one of those places where we can’t use these words all the time. But some of them are all right, some of the time. Ass is all right on television. You can say on television things like, well, you’ve made a perfect ass of yourself tonight. But you can’t say, hey, let’s go get some ass. Bitch, bitch is another word like that, same kind of word, it’s only dirty part of the time, depends on what you mean by bitch. You might be the lady from the San Diego Zoo visiting one of the Tonight Shows, and you might just have a bunch of little canines with you there. One of them is a female, and you say there’s the bitch, Johnny. And it’s okay, fine. Just don’t refer to the singer the same way, that’s all. Is that bitch gonna do another number? Yes. Animals are fine on those two-way words. And that’s it, that’s what I was trying to find, the words that were always dirty not just part of the time, but completely filth. Well, in… in looking for these words I kept finding new categories. We have so many ways of describing these dirty words, it’s, well, we have more ways to describe dirty words than we actually have dirty words. That seems a little strange to me. It seems to indicate that somebody was awfully interested in these words. They kept referring to them, they called them bad words, dirty, filthy, foul, vile, vulgar, coarse, in poor taste, unseemly, street talk, gutter talk, locker room language, barracks talk, bawdy, naughty, saucy, raunchy, rude, crude, lewd, lascivious, indecent, profane, obscene, blue, off-color, risque, suggestive, cursing, cussing, swearing. And all I could think of was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits, man. That’s all we have, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. That was my original list. I knew it wasn’t complete, but it was a starter set, you know? …mention WBAI? Shit, piss, fuck… yes, WBAI is the one who played them… shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. Now, that was the original list. We’ve added a few words since then, we’ve added fart, turd and twat. And I know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about, why they haven’t been considered, why they haven’t shown up on the list thus far. We’re looking at them all very closely. Some of your favorites might make the list this year; asshole, ballbag, hard on, piss hard, blue balls… nookie, snatch, box, pussy, pecker, peckerhead, peckertracks, jism, joint, donicker, dork, poontang, cornhole and dingleberry. Dingleberry, a very popular word. And to my way of thinking, dingleberry a rather innocent sounding word, dingleberry, sounds Christmasy to me, you know? Let’s put one on the tree, dad. So, the words, as I say, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Now, motherfucker came off the list immediately. The first day in fact I had a call from an English language purist, some guy had to, he had to talk, you know? He got on the phone. He tells me I have a duplicate on the list, I have a duplication. He says motherfucker is a duplication of the word fuck, technically. Because fuck is the root form, motherfucker being a derivative, therefore, it constitutes duplication. And I said, hey, motherfucker, how did you get my phone number anyway? How did he know I even had a phone? I said look, man, it may be a derivative, but you still can’t say it. You still can’t say motherfucker on TV, can you? He said no, but you can’t say fuckee, fucking, fuckola, fuckarooni or fuckarino, either. Well, I said, yeah, that would crowd up my list something awful. So I just struck that motherfucker away. I struck it from the list, motherfucker was gone. Now, the list was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Does is sound like something’s missing? Does it sound like an old friend is gone? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Remember the old rhythm? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits. Now, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits, it falls apart. It isn’t going anywhere. And by now, cocksucker is the dominant word on the list. Previously, with motherfucker on the list, cocksucker was somewhat balanced out. They were the only multi-syllabic words on the list. But now cocksucker stands alone, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits, And who knows, maybe it doesn’t belong either. After all, motherfucker turned out to be a ringer, let’s take a look at cocksucker, see if this one belongs. We’ll divide the word cock and sucker from each other, those words. Sucker isn’t dirty, sucker, it’s suggestive as hell, but it isn’t dirty. And cock, that’s not dirty all the time, that’s one of those words that’s only partly filthy. Cock, if you’re talking about the animal, it’s perfectly all right. They used to read that to us from the bible in third grade, and we would laugh, man. Cock is in the bible. Remember the first time you heard about a cock fight. What? No. Get out of here. Get out of here. Even the word cocksucker itself has been twisted out of all of its original meaning, it’s been distorted. For some reason now, cocksucker means bad man. It’s a good woman, how did they do that? How did they do that? Well, tits is on the end of the list, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits. And you know it doesn’t belong on that list. I mean, it really doesn’t belong in with that kind of heavy-weight filth. Tits isn’t dirty, tits is a cute name, cute thing, cute idea, great fun, good name. Tits, hey, tits sounds like a friend. It sounds like a nickname, doesn’t it? Hey, Tits, come here man. Hey, Tits, I want you to meet Toots. Tits, this is Toots, Toots, Tits. Tits, cute word, nice word. I love a word that spells the same forwards and backwards like tit. Don’t you think it’s cute when a word is spelled the same forwards and backwards? I always wished my name was Otto, just so I could walk backwards and yell my name, you know? Otto, Otto, Otto, well, I had strange dreams. But the word tit is on the list because you can’t say it on television. You can’t say tit, imagine that, can’t say tits. You can say boobs. Boob is spelled the same forwards and backwards, too. Boobs is all right. You can’t say tits, but you can say boobs. In fact, boobs is an answer now on Match Game. I had boobs, Gene. Boobs, $200, tits, $200 fine maybe. You can’t say tits. You can say teats, teats is all right, providing you’re on at 5:00 in the morning and a cow is your guest. But you can’t say jugs, and you can’t say knockers, you know? That’s right, Danny, pull on the cow’s knockers. Right, grab a knocker in each hand, that a boy. Now alternate knockers, good deal. You can’t say that. Tits, tits sounds like a snack, you know? Well, I know what you’re thinking, but tits sounds almost, it sounds Nabisco to me. It sounds like Nabisco has… has reserved that name. Cause tits sounds like a thing at a party, pass the tits, would you, Bill? Say, those things are… responding. Well, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Fart, fart is like tit, it’s one of those words that isn’t that harmful. You know, it’s just a cute kind of a thing. Farts, well, farts can be a little harmful, it depends, it depends on who’s cooking. But, fart, fart is a cute… hey kids know farts are okay. Kids know farts are fun. Farts are shit without the mess, wow. Yeah, same funny sound, same vile smell, no fuss, no muss. Fart is an interesting word in this respect, talking about television, fart is extremely interesting because, dig this, you can’t say fart on television, we know that. You can’t say fart. And you can’t say fuck, either, on television. However, you can refer to fucking, you can talk about fucking, they do that all the time. Some of the times in the show you’re watching two people are probably fucking in the other room. Fucking is all right, fucking is part of the plot. A lot of plots are based on fucking. Will they fuck, should they fuck, have they fucked, did they fuck, will they fuck again, will they get sick from fucking, are they fucking too much, will they fuck each other’s friends, will they have a baby from fucking, will they be sorry they fucked, will they be glad they fucked? All fuck stories, every honeymoon joke is a fuck joke. Have you ever noticed it? Otherwise the people wouldn’t be on their honeymoon in the joke, they’d be knights or they’d sailors or something. They’re on their honeymoon, it’s got to be a fuck joke. Every little, every news… I’m sorry… every quiz master has stood there with his newlywed couple and said, and I understand you folks are on your honeymoon. Lots of fucking going on here, Lots of fucking over here. So they talk about fucking all they want, they just don’t call it that. They don’t call it what it is. They call it other things, they call it making love, which is fine, they call it going to bed with someone, having an affair, sleeping together, but they don’t call it fucking. On the other hand, fart, not only is fart a word you can’t use on television, but they never even refer to them, that’s how bad farts are compared to fucking. They don’t even refer to farts, there are no farts on television. You’ve never seen a reference to a fart, I’ve never seen a fart reference. No, wouldn’t you think that by now one guy would have gone, whew, whew. Do you think by now that one guy on the Johnny Carson panel just once would have said, hey, Ed, move down, man? Whew, wow. That was a Clydesdale fart, Ed. Give me the lighter, will ya, Johnny, wow. Geez, Ed, next time you’re sick you ought to see the nurse, you know? God, it’s not the smell so much, it’s the burning of my eyes. Well, we might live to see that, you never know. Remember when you were a kid, and maybe you were a little boy child like me, you had on short pants, maybe sitting in church, sitting on a wooden bench in church in the middle of the summer with short pants. You gotta fart, you know? And it’s up to you, you gotta work out a little maneuver that’s called the one cheek sneak. Right in tune with the organ. That’s why they call them pews, you know? Whew, whew, whew. Did you ever notice that your own farts smell okay? Say, that’s fairly decent. I think I’ll stay home today, do some reading in the closet. Now I mentioned the three extra words, fart, turd and twat. Turd is another word you can’t say on television, turd. But, you know, when you get right down to it, who wants to say it? I don’t even care if I ever hear that one again. Twat, twat is on the list for the same reason. It doesn’t mean anything else, you know? It only has that one meaning, twat’s twat, and that’s that. It’s not like prick, prick is one of those part-time dirty words. Prick is all right, you can say prick on television. You can say I pricked my finger, just don’t say you fingered your prick, that’s all. Now there are two words left which I will wind this thing up with, one of them is not, uh, dirty all the time, one of them is. Ball or balls is a word that’s mostly clean. It has many clean meanings, but… but it has a couple of meanings that might get you in trouble. And ball is one of those words you gotta think about how you’re gonna say it, and maybe you have to watch out for just a moment, but it’s okay for sports people, perfectly all right. When you’re a kid you grow up, they tell ya, go play with your ball. Really? But it’s okay for the sports announcer on the Game of the Week to tell you that Pete Rose has two balls on him, no problem at all. The whole country nods in agreement. But the announcer can’t tell you that he hurt his balls. He can’t tell Tony Kubeck, Tony, I think he hurt his balls on that play. It looks like it, he’s holding onto them. Well, that’s right, generally when they hurt their balls, they hold them, and he’s holding his, and I’d say he’s hurt them. Never mention ball injuries, they don’t say the balls were hurt, they say groin injuries. He had a groin injury. Do you know why we call it a groin injury, that’s the noise you make when you get hit there. Groin. Now, then, the other word I wanted to remind you of was the word fuck, which of course is the champ of the all-time dirty words. When they’re always dirty, by God, fuck is right at the head of the pack. Fuck’s a good, strong word. It’s a good, strong word for its purpose, and it’s a word that a lot of people have trouble with. Uh, it’s a… it’s an honest word, it’s a… it’s a forceful word, it has a lot of emotional baggage with it. When you hear the word fuck, you’re not just hearing the word, you’re hearing everything you ever heard about fucking. I mean, we have a lot of attitudes about fucking, some of them are rationale, and some of them aren’t. Some of them have joy in them, some have guilt and fear and all sorts of things, and the word fuck carries with it a lot of emotional baggage. When they say fuck. You go what, oh, oh, good. Oh, I thought you meant do it right away. God, you know, it’s, uh, it’s just a word that, that, well, it’ll clear the room awfully quick in some households. It’s a heavy, good, strong word. It’s a proud sounding word to me. Fuck, fuck, I am fuck. Who are you? Fuck of the Mountain. I just, uh, I just feel the word is getting a bad shake. The word has an image problem. The word fuck needs public relations help. It’s just a word, you know? That’s what you have to remember, it’s just a word, but it’s in such bad shape. Here’s a word that started out okay, it started out all right, nothing wrong with the word fuck originally. I mean, there it was, you’re not a bad word, you’re not a bad word, you’ve just gotten in with bad company, people. That’s all, just the word was all it was. The word in the original old English, as best I can find, fuck only meant to hit, to smite, to… to perhaps hit with a stick, to fuck the tree, to fuck the rock, to fuck thee. That’s all, and pretty soon, that’s all, I’ll hit you with my dick, honey. Look at that, that’s all it was, just a little, I’ll knock a little fuck on you there. That’s all it was, was a love tap when you get right down to it. That’s all fuck ever meant. All fuck ever meant was to make love, and to make life at the same time. That’s pretty magic. I mean, pretty noble things we think about, making love and making life, here was fuck hanging around with words like love and life. How did it get such a bad reputation? We fucked it up. Yeah, well, we… we put the aggression back into the word. Fuck you, fuck you, you fuck. Fuck you, you fuck. Who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with, some kind of a fuckhead? Fuck you. Who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with, me? Don’t fuck with me, I’ll fuck over you. You fuck with me and you’ll get fucked, you fuck. Don’t fuck with me, I’m the fucker. Don’t fuck with the fucker. God, it sounds like combat, man. It’s got an awful lot, there’s an awful lot of hostility in the way that word is used. There’s an awful lot of aggression going down in the name of fucking, imagine that. I’d just like to help a little, my feeling was, hey, here’s a word that, uh, maybe we could save, you know, just by paying a little close attention to it. The trouble is with all that aggression and all that violence, that we lose track of those two things, and people start talking about sex and violence like they’re one thing. There’s some sort of an overlapping, there’s some sort of a gray area between sex and violence that some people really are confused about. There are people running around talking about sex and violence as if it’s one thing, as if it starts with an S and ends with a E. We’re gonna stamp it out of the comics, we’re gonna stamp it out of the Dixie Cup, we’re gonna stamp it out of homes. Sex and violence, hey, they are different, after all. And, some people even like them together, there are, true, people who do like a little violence with their sex. I’m not… I don’t care for that myself, I like my violence a little earlier in the afternoon, you know? Right around 2:00 o’clock a real good ass kicking and then everything’s all right. But, uh, the word make love, not war, someone pointed it out finally, they made it very clear for us. Make love, not war. I wish I had thought of that phrase, you know? I really would have been very happy with myself if I had thought of that one. Man, I would have retired the same day. I would have left my car at the red light, man. I’d say that’s it, folks, I’m going to the beach. You got it, make love, not war. Well, I didn’t think of it, but I do have my own phrase; make fuck, not kill. It’s not as graceful a phrase, but I’m not looking to retire, either. The whole idea of make fuck, not kill, is simply to switch the meanings of the words. I suggest that for one year we trade meanings on fuck and kill, just fuck for kill, and kill for fuck, that’s it. Don’t worry about what they really are, someone else will take care of real fucking and real killing. I’m just worried about what we call it… them. We call them fucking and killing. I say switch them around. I think it would be an insight, I think we’d get a new slant on how we feel about these words if we just change fucking for killing for about a year, that’s all. Imagine it. Sure would be fun watching TV during that time, huh? Better get down off the horse, Sheriff, we’re fixing to fuck you now. Mad fucker still on the loose. Not anymore, he’s made his first big mistake, my friend, he fucked a cop today. That makes him a cop fucker. Pardon me, boys, my horse broke his leg, I’m gonna have to fuck him, I’ll be right back. Shamu, the fucker whale. And To Fuck a Mockingbird, hold gently by the wings. So all I’m trying to suggest is that fuck you can be a positive phrase. If you hear it from across the street… Fuck you. Okay.',\n",

Well, like most people, I did all my practicing at home in my own neighborhood. I grew up on the Upper West Side of New York City, General Grant was one of my neighbors. I had a lot of fun in my neighborhood, I did a lot of practicing. And sooner or later, I just wanted to get downtown to show them what I could do. And I had to find out how to get there. In New York City if you don\\u2019t know how to get somewhere, all you gotta do is ask somebody, they\\u2019ll tell ya, even if they don\\u2019t know. Hey, tell me something, you got a second? Uh-huh. How do you get to Carnegie Hall? I don\\u2019t know, I gonna really tell you. I don\\u2019t know how to get to Carnegie Hall. Yeah, you from around here? Uh, yeah, I live right there, man. I don\\u2019t even know where I am now, how the hell could I tell you how to get to Carnegie Hall. How do you get to Carnegie Hall? From here? Well, no, from the moon. Take the bus up on the corner there down to 57th Street, get off there, that\\u2019s a block walk. Can\\u2019t I take the subway here? Got a gun permit? Take the plane. Take the plane? The 59th Street plane? Well, that depends on which way you wanna go. Well, all I can say, you can take a car down there. Take the bus, it\\u2019ll leave you right in front of there. Okay. I don\\u2019t know the number, but I get there. Jump on a cab, tell the man to take you downtown, you ain\\u2019t got no bread, just jump out. How do you get to Carnegie Hall? Yeah. Well, if you don\\u2019t have a car, you use subway. And then if you don\\u2019t have money, you hop the turnstile. You hop\\u2026 Hop the turnstile. Then if you\\u2019re for real, you go to court. As you can see, not everybody agrees on how to get there. Now, when I was a kid, if you wanted to get somewhere, you had to take whatever ride was available. I believe my ride has just arrived. We want George, we want George, we want George\\u2026 Hi there, how are you? Hello there. How you doing? Good evening everybody. Hello there. Thank you. Thanks a lot.Have you noticed that most of the women who are against abortion are women that you wouldn\\u2019t want to fuck in the first place?Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen, good evening, my name is George Carlin, and I am a professional comedian, as opposed to the kind you run into at work all day long. It\\u2019s nice being a comedian, there are, uh, certain advantages, naturally. And a few disadvantages, there are some drawbacks to being a comedian. No one on death row has ever said, \\u201cBefore I die, I wanna talk to a comedian.\\u201d You ever hear anyone at the scene of an accident say, \\u201cQuick, call a comedian, for God sakes!\\u201d But it would be kind of fun at an accident to push your way through the crowd and say, \\u201cMay I be of help, I\\u2019m a professional comedian.\\u201d And sooner or later, at least once in your life, when the policeman says to you, \\u201cWhat are you, a comedian?\\u201d You\\u2019ve gotta look him right in the eye and say, actually, yes. Even criminals have no respect for comedians. What do they say, first thing they do when they hold you up? \\u201cDon\\u2019t try anything funny. First one makes a funny move gets it.\\u201d Whenever they\\u2019re not looking I go. Well, that\\u2019s my job, thinking up goofy shit. Thinking up goofy shit, coming around every now and then, letting you know what it is, or reminding you of things you already know, but forgot to laugh at the first time they happened. We all have things like that, you hear it during the day and then you don\\u2019t remember it at all. For instance, I\\u2019ve noticed they have disposable douche, and I\\u2019m wondering who would want to keep it in the first place!I do have a lot, some not a lot, but I have some notes over here, and, uh, the reason for that is I haven\\u2019t been doing this lately, I want to make sure I know and remember everything tonight. I\\u2019ve been taking a little time off, six months I think I took, uh, three of them, uh, quite voluntarily, and the other three quite against my will. I had a heart attack, or as they say in Boston, I had a heart attack. He had a heart attack, you hear about George? He had a goddamn myocardial infarction. I had a heart attack. Fortunately, my pharmacist, my cardiologist and my doctor give me CPR. But I would like to bring you up to date, uh, on the comedian\\u2019s health sweepstakes. As it stands right now, I lead Richard Prior in heart attacks, two to one. I am ahead, I am ahead, that\\u2019s right. Now, however, Richard still leads me one to nothing on burning yourself up. Well, the way it happened was, first Richard had a heart attack, then I had a heart attack, then Richard burned himself up, then I said fuck that, I\\u2019m gonna have another heart attack.I had an interesting morning, got into an argument\\u2026 got into an argument with my Rice Krispies. I distinctly heard \\u201cSnap, crackle, fuck him.\\u201d I don\\u2019t know which one of them said it, I was reaching for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl. But I told them, I said, well, you can all just sit right there in the milk, far as I\\u2019m concerned you can sit in the milk until I find out which one of you said that. A little mass punishment for my breakfast food. The idea is to turn them against one another. Just sit in the milk, far as I\\u2019m concerned. Silly me, big punishment, that\\u2019s what they do anyway, Sit in the milk. That\\u2019s their job. That\\u2019s Rice Krispies\\u2019 job, sitting in the milk. You\\u2019ve seen them, haven\\u2019t you? Floating along, little beige blisters of air, riding proudly in the milk. But you can\\u2019t sink them, they float for a long time. And you know why, they stay together. They gather together in little groups, little groups of eight, ten, twelve, sometimes fourteen, but always an even number if you\\u2019ve noticed. It\\u2019s the polarity of the Krispies that attracts them. They form little colonies of Rice Krispies. But you can\\u2019t sink them, you try to sink them with a spoon, they come up over the sides. You can\\u2019t sink them, that\\u2019s what the fruit is for, sinking the Rice Krispies. Good size peach will take down 80 or 90 of them. If I\\u2019m really pissed, I\\u2019ll drop a watermelon on them.But I say interesting about my morning \\u2019cause it was, it\\u2019s not\\u2026 I don\\u2019t have a nice day anymore. I don\\u2019t bother much with that. I think I\\u2019m beyond that now, I think I\\u2019ve outgrown the nice day. I think I\\u2019ve had my share. Why should I be hogging all the really nice ones? Let somebody else have a few. Of course, everybody still wants me to have one. Everybody wants me to have a nice day. Have a nice day! Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wanna give me my fucking change, please? I\\u2019m triple parked. Some of them are really insistent, I said have a nice day! All right, all right, goddammit, all right, I\\u2019ll give it a shot! That\\u2019s the trouble with have a nice day, it puts all the pressure on you. Now you\\u2019ve gotta go out and somehow manage to have a good time, all because of some loose-lipped cashier. Have a nice day, maybe I don\\u2019t feel like having a nice day. Maybe, just maybe, I\\u2019ve had 116 nice days in a row, and I\\u2019m ready, by God, for a crappy day. I never hear that, let them wish one of them. Hey, have a crappy day. Thank you, and to your wonderful family, as well. A crappy day, hey, that would be easy, it\\u2019s no trouble at all, a crappy day. Just get up. There\\u2019s no planning involved for a crappy day.I know what it is that bothers me about that whole thing, it\\u2019s the word nice. It\\u2019s just a weak word, it doesn\\u2019t have a lot of character, you know? Nice. Isn\\u2019t he nice? Oh, he is so nice. And she\\u2019s nice, too. Isn\\u2019t that nice? How nice they are. I don\\u2019t care for that, you know? That\\u2019s like fine. There\\u2019s another word. How are you? Fine. Bullshit! Nobody\\u2019s fine. Hair is fine. How\\u2019s your hair? Fine. That makes a lot more sense to me. Some guys are great. Did you ever meet those guys? Great. Isn\\u2019t this great? Goddamn, this is great. Look, they\\u2019re kill that guy. Isn\\u2019t that great? That\\u2019s great. No, not me, I\\u2019m not nice, I\\u2019m not fine, I\\u2019m not great. People ask me how I am, I say I\\u2019m fairly decent. I don\\u2019t give them any superlatives, nothing to gossip about. Relatively okay. Sometimes I\\u2019ll say I\\u2019m moderately neato. If I\\u2019m in a particularly jaunty mood, I\\u2019ll say, I\\u2019m not unwell, thank you. That pisses them off because they have to figure that one out for themselves.So\\u2026 it reminds me of something my first grade teacher used to say to me, a little lady. She used to say, you show me a tropical fruit, and I\\u2019ll show you a cocksucker from Guatemala. No, that, that was someone else, that was someone else. I think it was someone I met in the Army. Always confuse them, I don\\u2019t know what it is.Ever been looking through the refrigerator and come across an empty plate? Well, that starts me to wondering. I think, did something eat something else? Maybe the olives ate the peas. Maybe that chicken isn\\u2019t really dead, and he\\u2019s grazing on my stuff. Actually, I picture a little mouse with gloves and a parka on, you know, just\\u2026 just waiting for the lights to go out so he can get back to work. I guess the worst thing that can happen cleaning out or looking through the refrigerator is to come across\\u2026 something\\u2026 that you cannot identify\\u2026 at all. You literally do not know what it is. It could be meat, it could be cake. Usually at a time like that I\\u2019ll bluff. Honey, is this good? Well, what is it? I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019ve never seen anything like it. It looks like meat-cake. Well, smell it. Actually, it has no smell whatsoever. It\\u2019s good, put it back. Somebody is saving it. It\\u2019ll turn up in something. That\\u2019s what frightens me.I was what they called a fussy eater. He\\u2019s fussy. He\\u2019s a fussy eater. Fussy eater is a euphemism for big pain in the ass. I mean, if I didn\\u2019t like something, I told them. I didn\\u2019t play with my food, pick at my food, I said I don\\u2019t like that. You make this, I don\\u2019t like it. Why? They wanted reasons. Well, you don\\u2019t always have a reason. I don\\u2019t know. I know I don\\u2019t like it. And I know that if I ate it, I would like it even less. You like it, you eat it. Then they would try to corner me with logic, how do you know you don\\u2019t like it if you\\u2019ve never even tried? It came to me in a dream. Big pain in the ass.Some things I didn\\u2019t like just because of the sound of the foods. To this day, I can still not eat\\u2026 yogurt, yogurt. It sounds like it\\u2019s coming up again. Yogurt, yogurt. I can\\u2019t eat anything with a Y and a G in it. Something else that doesn\\u2019t sound so good, squash. You want some squash? Shit no! Sounds like somebody sat on my dinner. Succotash. Want some succotash? What did you call me, you fuck? Look out, hey, look out, come on. Hey, hey, fucking cool out. Hey, it\\u2019s fucking lima beans and corn. Cool out, cool out. Wheat germ. No, get off my plate. Even something like eggplant. Well, which one is it anyway? Tell it to make up its mind and then come on back. Terrible sounding food, head cheese. I can\\u2019t even look at the sign. I\\u2019ll be down near the baloney, you look at it. Between head cheese and blood tongue, I may never eat again. It certainly won\\u2019t be at the deli.Then there are some foods that sound too humorous to eat. Did you ever hear of something too funny to eat? Guacamole. That sounds like something you wear to a dance. May I borrow your green guacamole? Garbanzo. Hey, want some garbanzos? It sounds like a circus act. Ladies and gentlemen, the garbanzos. And the funniest food of all time, kumquats. I don\\u2019t even bring them home anymore. They just go to waste.Some things don\\u2019t look right. I don\\u2019t like that, ma. Don\\u2019t look right to me. Did you make that? Is there a picture of it in the cookbook? I\\u2019ll bet it don\\u2019t look like that. Let\\u2019s face it, be honest, some things don\\u2019t look right. Of course, some people eat anything, I know that. Some guys will eat anything. I saw those guys in the Army on the chow line. What\\u2019s this, never mind, give me a whole lot of it. That\\u2019s rat\\u2019s asshole, Don. Well, it certainly makes a hell of a fondue. Don\\u2019t look right. I don\\u2019t eat anything I don\\u2019t recognize immediately. If I have to ask questions, fuck it, I pass, you know? Tomatoes don\\u2019t look right, either. On the outside, they\\u2019re fine. Tomatoes look lovely on the outside. But you look inside a tomato and something is wrong. Something has gone afoul inside of a tomato. It doesn\\u2019t look right, you know? It doesn\\u2019t look like it\\u2019s finished yet, for one thing. It looks like it\\u2019s in the larval stage or something. There\\u2019s thousands of seeds and a whole bunch of jelly looking stuff. Get it off my plate. It\\u2019s gushy, it\\u2019s like that stuff at the end of an egg. And I know it\\u2019s not the end of an egg, it\\u2019s the beginning of a chicken. It\\u2019s hen cum. Get it off my plate. It don\\u2019t look right. Something else that doesn\\u2019t look like food, lobsters and crabs. I mean, anything coming at me walking sideways with big pincers somehow doesn\\u2019t make me hungry. In fact, my instinct is step on that fuck. Look at the big bug, step on the big bug before he gets to the children. They look like they mean business. Can\\u2019t order frogs legs in a restaurant. I keep wondering what did they do with the rest of the frog? What do they do with it, they give them little dollies and send them back out into the world to beg? Try, try to return them to a normal life if you can. The trouble is, the dollies for froggies program has been cut in half. We\\u2019ve probably seen the last froggie dolly for a long, long time. I\\u2019d rather eat a box of cookies. Doesn\\u2019t that always come in handy? Just eat a goddamn box of cookies. You ever do that, a whole box of cookies right in a row. I don\\u2019t mean you take them out. I mean eat them in the kitchen, standing right in the kitchen. Eat a whole goddamn box of cookies. Just stare at the electric clock while you\\u2019re eating those cookies. Did you ever notice right on the cookies it says open here. Well, what the fuck do they think you\\u2019re gonna do, move to Hong Kong to open up their cookies? Of course you\\u2019re going to open them here, you\\u2019re going to eat them here. You almost have to open them here. Thank God it doesn\\u2019t say open somewhere else. Shit, I\\u2019d be up all night trying to find a good location.Got a little news for you.

They were so happy with what they discovered that they went out to celebrate, and they met another guy, and he went, da da da la la la la la la la la, da da da la la la la la la la la, da da da la la la la la la la la, da da da la la la la.

He flies in a straight line.Do you realize that somewhere in the world is the worst doctor? Has to be, process of elimination, sooner or later you\\u2019re gonna find the worst doctor. And the weird part is that\\u2026 someone has an appointment to see him tomorrow.Yeah, I know, youse are trying to butter me up. Don\\u2019t give me that shit. Yes, in goddamn deed. I love that dog. I\\u2019ve never seen him and I love him. He\\u2019s gonna be wonderful when I meet that dog. Hey, you want a dog? You want a goddamn dog? Go ahead man, you can have a dog. I got three of them, man. You want a fucking dog? You have it man, it\\u2019s yours. Lots of people got lots of goddamn doggies. And you don\\u2019t even have to have one to learn about doggies, your friend might have a dog. It could be your friend\\u2019s dog. He makes you\\u2026 that makes him your dog friend. You go to visit your friend and his dog is there and you pet him. Hi, hello. How are you Sneezie? You\\u2019re wonderful. Hello, goddamn. I mean, for that moment, he\\u2019s your dog. So you can have someone else\\u2019s dog for a while. Hi, he likes, he likes me. I think, oh my God, look at this doggie here. Goddamn doggies. There\\u2019s lots of things to know about him, too. Lots of things you learn. You don\\u2019t know where always, and you can\\u2019t remember. For instance, can you remember the first time you found out that by scratching a dog here, you could make this leg go like that. And, that you could make it stop when you stop. Goddamn, I\\u2019m in complete control of this dog. Or that you can make their head tilt from across the room just by making a funny noise. You go\\u2026 and he goes. Oh look honey, isn\\u2019t he cute? Let\\u2019s get his head fixed so he stays like that. Oh, you can get their heads done. Cost you a bundle, and they don\\u2019t like it. Makes them move to the same side all the time. Cute little goddamn doggie. Do you ever eat candy right in front of your dog? I don\\u2019t mean a Milky Way. I mean one at a time candy, like M&Ms. And you watch where he\\u2019s looking, he\\u2019s following your fingertips. Oh, boy, this asshole drops one Jujube, I\\u2019m going for his femoral artery. Did you ever spell in front of your dog? Some of them are smart. You\\u2019ve gotta spell. Honey, do we have any more b-o-n-e-s? B, they know the sound of B alone. B, bone, bone, bone. Take it easy, take it easy. You know, there\\u2019s all kinds of dogs, and all sizes of dogs, too. There\\u2019s a lot of goddamn big dogs, you know, big dogs. I don\\u2019t mean big. I don\\u2019t mean a big dog. I mean a fucking-big-dog. Some people have got goddamn big doggies. Look like they ought to have commercial license plate on them. Livestock dogs. What the hell is that? That\\u2019s my dog. He blocked out the sun. That\\u2019s Tiny. Little dog is different. Little dog will get around and do fine. He\\u2019ll jump all he wants. I don\\u2019t know how they jump so high. They got little teeny legs like this. They got legs, if you feel a little dog\\u2019s leg, it feels like a beef jerky in there, man. They can jump up on the bed all they want to. Holy God, do that again. Oh, man, one more time. I make him keep doing it till he can\\u2019t reach anymore, boom, boom, boom. Then if I want him up there, I\\u2019ll put him up there. And sooner or later, what\\u2019s gonna happen with the little dog? Sooner or later, lying on the bed he\\u2019s gonna create an incident. He\\u2019s gonna make one of you humans turn to the other and say, whew. Honey, did you fart? Not me, I thought you farted. Not me, whew. That\\u2019s not even one of my farts. I\\u2019ve got four farts, and that\\u2019s not one of mine. I\\u2019ve got my Heineken\\u2019s fart, I got my broccoli fart, my rice pudding fart, and my non-dairy creamer fart, and that\\u2019s not one of my farts. I know\\u2026 the dog farted. Tippy, why did you fart? Look at him, he knows he farted. I seen his asshole open up. I seen it. Well, I happened to be looking at his asshole by chance. What kind of a question is that? I thought he was doing them deep breathing exercises. You see, dogs have nothing to do. There\\u2019s no job description for a dog. They\\u2019re forced to wait for something to happen that they can get in on. If you do something, they\\u2019ll be glad to join you. But they rarely initiate any activity on their own. They\\u2019re just waiting, waiting, waiting and waiting and waiting. Waiting to come in, waiting to go out, waiting to eat, waiting to crap, waiting to wake up, waiting to sleep, waiting to go upstairs, waiting to go downstairs. Sometimes they\\u2019re just waiting to wait. You ever seen a dog just standing there? He don\\u2019t know what he\\u2019s waiting for, but if it happens, he\\u2019ll be ready. Just a waiting and a waiting, waiting for you to come home. They don\\u2019t understand time. A dog doesn\\u2019t know the difference between an hour and a half or next week. He thinks you\\u2019re going to be gone forever. That\\u2019s the only time period dogs really understand, forever. That\\u2019s how long they think everything lasts. That\\u2019s how long they think everything takes, forever and ever. Did you ever scratch your dog behind the ears? Oh boy, they love that, huh? The more you scratching your doggie behind the ears and he really loves that, and you\\u2019re looking at him and everything, and when you finally stop he looks at you like you\\u2019re a criminal. He thought it was gonna go on and on and on. Same thing when you feed them, soon as they get finished they say, where the fuck\\u2019s the food? They thought it was the loaves and the fishes, it was gonna last forever and ever. Dog don\\u2019t know, they must think we\\u2019re gonna be gone forever, otherwise why would they act the way they do when we finally get home. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. I thought you were never gonna come home, I thought you were never gonna come home, I thought you were never gonna come home, I thought you were never gonna come home. I didn\\u2019t know what to do. You know what? I don\\u2019t know how to operate the can opener. How do you operate the can opener? I didn\\u2019t know what to do, man. What, do you push it down? I couldn\\u2019t think of it. Do you know what? Do you know what I did? I took a can of dog food and I rolled it down the hill, and hoped a truck ran it over. That\\u2019s all I could think of, man. I mean, they\\u2019ll do that if you even just forgot your hat. You come back in eight seconds, oh boy, oh boy, I thought you were never gonna come home, I thought you were never gonna come home. I was gonna eat your bird, I couldn\\u2019t find the bird. Where the fuck\\u2019s the bird? Will you stop that, I was just here. God, they get you mad sometimes, don\\u2019t they? Do you ever get mad at your dog, and you feel really dumb and you get all the way to work and you\\u2019re still pissed at your pet. What\\u2019s the matter, Dan? Well, the dog, goddamn it, never mind. He chewed the legs off everything. Okay, I\\u2019ll see you at lunch. Dog don\\u2019t care. He\\u2019ll do whatever is next. He don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s next, but he\\u2019ll do something. They\\u2019ll do two things in a row that don\\u2019t go together. You ever seen a dog walking through a room and suddenly he stops and chews his back for 18 minutes? And then when he\\u2019s finished chewing, as if it were scheduled for right then, of course, then when he\\u2019s finished he doesn\\u2019t even know where it was he was gonna go. Where was I gonna go? Oh, shit, oh, I think I\\u2019ll go over here. Oh, this is nice over here. I think I\\u2019ll keep coming over here. He don\\u2019t know, he don\\u2019t care. Dog don\\u2019t care. Like I say, he\\u2019ll do anything. He might embarrass you. He might do something inappropriate when you have company, huh? You might have some folks in visiting you, some of them you don\\u2019t know that well, trying to impress a couple of them. Hey, you might be trying to borrow money off one of these studs. Dog is lying out there in the living room, you got all these people sitting around, you got a little chip, a little dip. Dog\\u2019s in full view of everyone, got carrot sticks, celery sticks, little lady fingers, finger ladies, all sorts of little things that you got. And everybody\\u2019s eating nicely, and you look down and you realize that the dog is licking his balls. No one says anything, no one mentions it, spectacular thing going on. Hey, if I could reach, I\\u2019d never leave the house. Are you kidding? Poor little guy. He didn\\u2019t mean it. He didn\\u2019t mean it. He\\u2019ll come, he\\u2019ll apologize to you. He\\u2019ll come around a few hours later and apologize. He\\u2019ll give you that doggie look, give you them eyes, you know, they have such a great expression, almost human. Sometimes we say that. Isn\\u2019t he, look, he looks almost human, Dan. They do, you know? They look like they know something about your mother. They\\u2019re not willing to mention it right away. They\\u2019re just looking at you like they got a trig problem they can\\u2019t quite solve. There\\u2019s a, there\\u2019s a sad look in their eyes, all the sadness in the world is right in the eyes of a dog. Did you ever do this? Look right into your doggie\\u2019s eyes and think of something really sad. And it\\u2019ll look like it\\u2019s happening to your dog. Strangest thing, they look at you like that. You know why they have so successful a look, cause they got eyebrows. Dogs have eyebrows, or at least little ridges that pass for eyebrows. They got little things\\u2026 that they can manipulate, just like we do. Oh, please\\u2026 please daddy, one\\u2026 more\\u2026 treat.Cats can\\u2019t look at you like that. Cats don\\u2019t look at that\\u2026 cats look at you coldly, as if they\\u2019re testing new eyes. Reason cats look different, cats don\\u2019t have eyebrows. Cats have a bunch of shit sticking out of their head. They thought it was gonna be an eyebrow, but it didn\\u2019t work out. Let\\u2019s not tell them, they think it\\u2019s an eyebrow. It\\u2019s just a bunch of shit, sticking out of their heads. Cats are all different. They do everything different than a doggie. Cats are cute, cats are goddamn cute. Isn\\u2019t he cute? Look at him, God, he\\u2019s cute. He\\u2019s a kitty cat. That\\u2019s how cute they are. They needed two names. Kitty wasn\\u2019t cute enough, kitty cat. Isn\\u2019t he cute? The kitty cat, look at him. Isn\\u2019t he cute? Let\\u2019s drown him. He\\u2019s a cute little goddamn kitty cat, ain\\u2019t he? Look. Stick on the wall, see if he hangs up there. Whoa! Little goddamn kitty cat. They\\u2019re so goddamn cute when they\\u2019re teeny. I hope he stays that size forever. He\\u2019s darling. Isn\\u2019t he wonderful? Cute little goddamn kitty cat. They can jump any way they want. When they\\u2019re teeny, they can jump straight up in the air without a run. They just go vooom. They can even jump backwards to the side. How\\u2019d he do that? Holy shit. They can do anything. Jump and be cute as can be, cute goddamn kitty cat. Isn\\u2019t he cute? God, I love them. They\\u2019re so cute. They\\u2019re even cute when they kill. Isn\\u2019t he, Look, he\\u2019s playing with the mouse. Bullshit. Mouse doesn\\u2019t feel that way. They\\u2019re cute. Oh, he\\u2019s so precious, just tearing the throat right out of that bird. Cute as can be. They kill, see, they like to kill something. That\\u2019s what they want to do, that\\u2019s why they act so nice. They wanna go yaaah. Even when they\\u2019re teeny, when they\\u2019re just born. You take a baby, baby, that is a human, you take a baby dog and a baby cat, and you attack all three of them, which I try never to do if I can help it, but you\\u2019ll get three different results. You attack a baby, he cries. You attack a puppy, he cowers. You attack kitty cat, he fights. One day old, they\\u2019re looking for some shit. They ain\\u2019t even got their eyes open, they\\u2019ll grab anything. Nasty little cute thing. Cute little nasty guy. Oh, they\\u2019re wonderful, God love them. They\\u2019re so physical. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s fun. They\\u2019re so physical. They love to rub on you. They love to rub on you. If you\\u2019ve got a leg and a cat, whew, you got a party. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, I love his leg, oh boy. I\\u2019m rubbing on his leg, oh boy, oh boy. If you got two legs, shit, jubilee celebration time. Oh boy, two legs, hot shit. I can do the figure eight. They love to do the figure eight, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. I love to rub on his leg. They\\u2019ll rub against your leg even if you\\u2019re not there yet. You might still be 50 feet down the hall, they see you coming, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, soon I\\u2019ll be rubbing on his leg, soon. They\\u2019ll even walk sideways so they don\\u2019t miss you, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. They love it. They\\u2019re so physical. You don\\u2019t have to pet a cat, you just put your hand over him and he\\u2019ll do all the work, man. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. You pet him, you ever pet a cat who\\u2019s lying absolutely flat, and before you\\u2019re halfway finished his ass is way up in the air. Like you pressed the ass button or something. Isn\\u2019t he a cute little\\u2026 holy shit, how did he do that? Then they jump on your chest and put their ass right in your face. Here\\u2019s my ass, dad, check this ass, huh? And while they\\u2019re showing you their ass, they give you some of this stuff. I say get him off of me, Jesus, I hate that. I don\\u2019t even know what it is, and I don\\u2019t like it. It looked like they\\u2019re into some bad drug. There\\u2019s one other quality cats have, which, uh, I admire, cats don\\u2019t accept blame. They don\\u2019t embarrass at all. A cat does something dumb, you\\u2019d never know it by looking at him. Dog knocks over a lamp, you can tell who did it just by looking at the dog. Not the cat. Cat doesn\\u2019t accept any blame. Cat moves along to the next activity. What\\u2019s that? Not me, fuck that, I\\u2019m a cat. Something break, ask the dog. Cat doesn\\u2019t get embarrassed. You ever seen a cat race across a carpet and crash into a glass door? I meant that, I meant that, I meant that. That\\u2019s exactly how I wanted that to look. Fucking meow, fucking meow, fucking meow. That\\u2019s what they say when they get behind the couch. A cat\\u2019s too proud to let you see him suffer, but you look behind the couch and you\\u2019ll find your cat recuperating from a domestic accident. They got little slings and walkers, you know. Tried to make the window from the lamp. Little kitty cat, goddamn kitty cat. Do you realize Hitler only had one ball? What do you think about a man with one ball? Do you think he has two strikes against him? Maybe he\\u2019s got one ball and two strikes. Hitler only had one ball. A lot of people don\\u2019t know that. A lot of people don\\u2019t know that. They say Hitler, geez, he had a lot of balls\\u2026 one.For some time I was trying to get a list of words together that would fairly represent the dirty words, cause nobody gives you a list of dirty words for life, have you noticed that? There\\u2019s some words that are perfectly clean but sound like they could be filthy if you gave them just a little help. A word like pussyfoot. It\\u2019s perfectly clean. But when you say pussyfoot there\\u2019s a little giggle, cause people know that with a little help this word could be filthy. No matter what form of the verb you try, it\\u2019s clean as a verb, but pussyfoot could be a noun. It could be a noun, pussyfoot, a rare disorder. A female birth defect. Hello boys, I have pussyfoot. God, you sure do, lady. And I love them open-toed shoes you have on. Well, I\\u2019d rather have pussyfoot than woodpecker, I can say that.Or beer nuts. God, that must be awful. Beer nuts, the official disease of Milwaukee. I know whenever I see the little canister behind the bar, I drop in a couple of dollars for beer nuts. I think we need a lot more research on beer nuts. Or, cotton balls. Which is the dreaded final stage of beer nuts. When my beer nuts turn to cotton balls, I\\u2019ll be heading home to you. It\\u2019s an old Southern hymn.Lots of little phrases like that in the language that don\\u2019t quite say what they mean. Take a shit is another one. Take a shit!? You don\\u2019t take shit, you leave a shit! That\\u2019s the whole idea, to leave it. I left a shit. Fine, thank you, Jeff. Where\\u2019d you leave it? In the icebox. I\\u2019m gonna take a shit. Don\\u2019t take one of mine! I only have two left and the weekend is coming up. Why don\\u2019t you go home and take one of your own shits. Guy\\u2019s always mooching off me. He must think I\\u2019m made of shit or something. Boy, that shit don\\u2019t grow on trees, you know? Well, enough of that shit. Lots of little phrases like that.Pick your nose is, well, blow your nose. Blow your nose is a phrase. Imagine that, blowing your nose. I don\\u2019t believe they really mean that, do you? You can\\u2019t blow your nose. I believe it\\u2019s physically impossible to blow your nose. You might get somebody else to blow your nose, but it would have to be a real good friend.Cocktails, another clean word. You can advertise them. You can put up signs all over town, cocktails. As long as you use both halves of the word, perfectly fine. But you can\\u2019t advertise either one of those two items if you break those words in half. They\\u2019ll come and take your sign down. Cocktail, it\\u2019s okay. It depends on how you say that kind of word. You ladies like some cocktails? Hey lady, you want a cocktail?Cockpit. Men will actually laugh about that, cockpit. Get it? Oh yeah.Bangkok, there\\u2019s a lovely city. How would you like to be a hooker in Bangkok? It would seem like a natural habitat.Peacock. NBC is really proud of their peacock. You know what a female peacock is? A peacunt.My list, I was just trying to isolate the words that were always filthy, not the ones that were sometimes dirty. And the original list was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. This was all I could think of in one sitting, just one try. But we had to add some, we had shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, and then we added fart, turd and twat, which also don\\u2019t have other meanings. You know, twat\\u2019s twat, and that\\u2019s that. But after a while, it didn\\u2019t take long, well, it took quite a while. But I finally discovered that there are only two words on the list you really had to deal with to sort of look at the double standard that television uses where language is concerned. Uh, the two words were fart and fuck. Those are the only two. They seem similar because you can\\u2019t say either one of them. You can\\u2019t say fart and you can\\u2019t say fuck. No matter how cleverly you try to work them in, no matter how clinical the conversation is, fart and fuck will not show up on the final tape. You simply cannot say them. But that\\u2019s where the similarity ends, cause at least with the word fuck, even though you can\\u2019t say the word fuck, you can talk about fucking. Oh, you can refer to fucking, there\\u2019s lots of fuck talk going on, on TV, they just don\\u2019t call it fucking. That\\u2019s the secret, they don\\u2019t use that word. There\\u2019s plenty of fuck talk. You see people who wrote a book about fucking. You\\u2019ll see a guy on a talk show who wrote a book about fucking. How to fuck, who to fuck, when to fuck, why to fuck and how to feel after you fuck. This man is a fuck expert and he wrote a fuck book, and he\\u2019s talking to Merv Griffin about fucking, and they\\u2019re getting away with it cause they don\\u2019t call it fucking. Same with the soap operas, everybody, you take a look at a soap opera, and you know everybody is fucking somebody on a soap opera. And if they\\u2019re not fucking somebody, they\\u2019re trying to fuck somebody. Will he fuck her, did he fuck her, has he fucked her, should he fuck her, can he fuck her some more, will they fuck too much, will they get silly from fucking, who is fucking who, that\\u2019s all you want to know, is what the fuck is going on, on this program here. You know that somebody is getting fucked, and you think it\\u2019s you. So there\\u2019s lots of fuck talk, and there\\u2019s plenty of fucking on television, they just don\\u2019t call it fucking. They call it everything else.Now, on the other hand, farts, not only can you not mention the word fart, but you can\\u2019t refer to farts at all. That\\u2019s how bad farts are, they\\u2019re worse than fucking. You never hear anybody talking about farts on TV. You\\u2019ve never seen a guy who wrote a book on farts; how to fart, who to fart at, how to feel after you fart. There\\u2019s no fart experts on the Merv Griffin Show, you don\\u2019t see any farts or fart references, it\\u2019s a fart free zone. Wouldn\\u2019t you think after 35 years one guy by now would have gone, whew? Just once, just once I\\u2019d like to see someone on the Johnny Carson panel say, Hey, Ed, move down, man. That was a Clydesdale fart.Well, anyway, uh, after a while I realized that I was needlessly restricting myself to seven words, and only to the ones that weren\\u2019t allowed on TV. I mean, there were a lot more to be looked at, and television isn\\u2019t the only place that objects to your language sometimes. There are lots of situations where you\\u2019re not supposed to say that. So I expanded the list by as many as I could, and I\\u2019d like to share some with you now. This list is a little longer than it was before. First we start with the ones we already know; shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Crap, balls, prick, asshole, jackoff, jerkoff, scumbag, douche bag, hard-on, rod-on, boner, stiff, piss hard, blue balls, nookie, cooze, gash, slash, hole, slit, snatch, box, beaver, pussy, bearded clam, gism, cum, cream, juice, pecker, peckerhead, peckertracks, dick, dork, dong, doniker, wang, shlong, shwans, pork, crabs, ass, butt, heinie, tuckus, bum, buns, cheeks, screw, lay, diddle, plow, hump, bang, poke, batter, wham, knock up, bugger, ground, jugs, bazooms, knockers, knobs, lungs, balloons, dildo, joy stick, hair pie, muff, cornhole, rim job, blow job, sugar bowl pie, suck off, give head, sit on my face, butt fuck, finger fuck, clap, bleat, 69, 71 which is 69 with two fingers up your ass, daisy chain, circle jerk, cock teaser, wet dream, cunt struck, pussy whipped, short arm, tuna taco, group grope, milking the chicken, bulldagger, gangbang, ball breaker, ball buster, merkin, bananas and cream, up the old dirt road, around the world, beat your meat, whack off, flogging your dong, pounding your pud, beating the bishop, poontang, dingleberry, sit on it, fudge packer, milking the lizard, fart face, old fart, farting around, fart sniffer, ream, snake, raincoat, quickie, queer, queen, putz, put out, push, beef injection, dog style, pop your cookies, bust your nuts, one-eyed monster, knob, pocket pool, tail, piddle, paddle the pickle, one-man band, snapper, notch, garage, shaft, stick, piece of ass, goddammit, pimp, hooker, punk, faggot, dike, lezzie, box lunch, sea food, hand job, hammer, hatch, head job, hot nuts, hum job, prong, jelly roll, jerk the gherkin, lob, meat whistle, cheese, cat fan, middle leg, wanking, bootie, love muscle, snappin\\u2019 pussy, bitch, bastard, clam, bite the brown, going up mustard road, bone on, bush, button, cunt lapper, cherry, tool, dingus, quif, quim, get off, joint, peace, stem, root, crack, cootch, crud, eat me, fuck you, up your ass, get laid, fuck off, piss off, piss on you, stick it, stuff it, ram it, jam it, cram it, horny, peter, the one-eyed wonder worm, piece of ass, little brown eyeball, golden showers, pound cake, boy in the boat, brown eyes, brown nose, sloppy seconds, Mongolian cluster fuck, rod of love, copping a feel, copping a cherry, copping a joint, on the rag, flying the flag, riding the cotton pony, dipping your wick, going down on, dry hump, fist fuck, skin flute, french job, furburger, nuts, get your rocks off, get in, get it up, hung, ginch, gobble, diesel dock, rubber, shoot\\u2026 diesel dike that was\\u2026 syph, wad, cocksman, tit fuck, tongue, rough trade, trick, weenie and yodeling in the gully.

When it\\u2019s one on one, if some guy wants me to call him a morbidly obese, African-ancestored male with a same gendered sexual orientation I\\u2019ll be glad to do that. One the other hand if he wants me to call him a fat n*gger c0cksucker, than that\\u2019s what it will be. I\\u2019m here to please.If I meet a woman who wishes to be to be referred to as a motion-impaired, same gender-oriented Italian-American who is difficult to deal with, fine. On the other hand, I am perfectly willing to call her a crippled, Guinea dyk3 c*nt if she prefers. I\\u2019m not trying to change anyone\\u2019s self image. But! But! When I am speaking generally, and impersonally about a large group of people, I will call them what I think is honest and fair. And I will not try and bullshit myself.Okay, so, who exactly are these victims? Well, first of all, I don\\u2019t think everyone who says he is a victim automatically qualifies. I don\\u2019t think a homely, disfigured, bald minority person with a room temperature IQ who limps and stutters is necessarily always a victim. Although I will say that she probably shouldn\\u2019t be out trying to get work as a receptionist. But maybe that\\u2019s just the way it oughtta be.I\\u2019m more interested in the real victims. People who have been fucked over by the system. Because the United States is a Christian racist nation with a rigged economic system run for three hundred years by the least morally qualified of the two sexes, there were bound to be some real victims. People who have been elaborately fucked over.The way I see it, this country has only four real victim groups: Indians, blacks, women and gays. I purposely left out the Spanish and Asians, because when you look at what happened to the Indians and the blacks, the Spanish and Asian people had a walk in the park. It\\u2019s not even close. Not to downplay the shit they\\u2019ve had to eat, but in about one hundred years the Spanish and Asians are going to be running this country, so they\\u2019ll have plenty of chances to get even with the gray people.Let\\u2019s get to some of these other non-victims. You probably noticed elsewhere I used the word fat. I used that word because that\\u2019s what fat people are. They\\u2019re fat. They\\u2019re not large; they\\u2019re not stout, chunky, hefty, or plump. And they\\u2019re not big-boned. Dinosaurs are big-boned. These people are not necessarily obese either. Obese is a medical term. And they\\u2019re not overweight. Overweight implies there is some correct weight. There is no correct weight. Heavy is also a misleading term. An aircraft carrier is heavy, it is not fat. Only people are fat. That\\u2019s what fat people are. They\\u2019re fat. I offer no apology for this. It is not intended as criticism or insult. It is simply descriptive language. I don\\u2019t like euphemisms. Euphemisms are a form of lying. Fat people are not gravitationally disadvantaged. They\\u2019re fat. I prefer seeing things the way they are. Not the way some people wish they were.I don\\u2019t believe groups deserve extra-special names. For instance, midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs. They are not little people. Infants are little people; leprechauns are little people . Midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs. They don\\u2019t get any taller by calling them little people. I wish their lives were different. I wish they didn\\u2019t have to go around starring at other peoples crotches, but I can\\u2019t fix that. And I\\u2019m not going to lie about what they are. The politically sensitive commandos would probably like me to call them \\u201cvertically challenged\\u201d. They are not vertically challenged. A skydiver is vertically challenged. The person who designed the empire state building was vertically challenged. Midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs.Also, crippled people are crippled. They are not differently-abled. If you insist on using such tortured language as differently-abled, then you must use it on all of us. We\\u2019re all differently-abled. You can do things I can\\u2019t do. I can do things you can\\u2019t do. I can pick my nose with my thumb. I can switch hands while masturbating and gain a stroke. We are all differently-abled. Crippled people are crippled. It\\u2019s a perfectly honorable word. There is no shame in it. It\\u2019s in the Bible: \\u201cJesus healed the cripples\\u201d. He didn\\u2019t \\u201cengage in rehabilitative strategies for the physically disadvantaged\\u201d.So, leaving women and gays aside for a moment, I\\u2019ve narrowed it down to blacks and Indians. Let\\u2019s talk about what we ought to call them. And remember, this has nothing to do with the people themselves, it has to do with the words.And, by the way, when it comes to liberal language vandals, I must agree with there underlying premise: White Europeans and their descendants are morally unattractive people who are responsible for most of the world\\u2019s suffering. That part is easy. You would have to be, uh, visually impaired, not to see it. The impulse behind political correctness is a good one. But like every good impulse in America, it has to be grotesquely distorted beyond usefulness.Clearly, these are victims, but I don\\u2019t agree that these failed campus revolutionaries know what to do about them. When they\\u2019re not busy curtailing freedom of speech, they\\u2019re running around inventing absurd hyphenated names designed to make people feel better. Remember, these are the white elitists in there customary paternalistic role: protecting helpless, inept minority victims . Big Daddy White Boss always knows best.So, let me tell you how I handle some of these speech issues. First of all, I say \\u201cblack\\u201d. I say \\u201cblack\\u201d because most black people prefer \\u201cblack\\u201d. I don\\u2019t say \\u201cpeople of color\\u201d. People of color sounds like something you see when you are on mushrooms. Besides, the use of people of color is dishonest. It means precisely the same thing as colored people. If you\\u2019re not willing to say \\u201ccolored people\\u201d you shouldn\\u2019t be saying \\u201cpeople of color\\u201d.Besides, the whole idea of color is bullshit anyway. What should we call white people? \\u201cPeople of no color\\u201d? Isn\\u2019t pink a color? In fact, white people aren\\u2019t really white at all, they\\u2019re different shades of pink, olive and beige. In other words, they\\u2019re colored. And black people are rarely black. I see mostly different shades of brown and tan. In fact, some light-skinned black people are lighter than the darkest white people. Look how dark the people in India are. They\\u2019re dark brown but they\\u2019re still considered white people. What\\u2019s going on here? May I see the color chart? \\u201cPeople of color\\u201d is an awkward, bullshit , liberal-guilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it. Shall we call fat people, \\u201cpeople of size\\u201d?By the way, I think the whole reason we are encouraged in this country to think of ourselves as black and white (instead of pink and brown, which is what we are) is that black and white are complete opposites that cannot be reconciled. Black and white can never come together. Pink and brown, on the other hand, might just stand a chance of being blended, might just come together. Can\\u2019t have that! Doesn\\u2019t fit the plan.I also don\\u2019t say \\u201cAfrican-American\\u201d. I find it completely confusing. Which part of Africa are we talking about? What about Egypt? Egypt is in Africa. Egyptians aren\\u2019t black. They\\u2019re like the people in India, they\\u2019re the dark brown white people. But they\\u2019re Africans. So why wouldn\\u2019t an Egyptian who becomes a US citizen be an African-American?The same thing goes for the Republic of South Africa. Suppose a white racist from South Africa becomes an American citizen? Well, first of all, he\\u2019d find plenty of company, but couldn\\u2019t he also be called an African American? It seems to me that a racist white South-African guy could come here and call himself African-American just to piss off black people. And, by the way, what about a black person born in South Africa who moves here and becomes a citizen? What is he? Is he a African-South-African-American? Or a South-African-African-American? All right. Back to the hemisphere. How about a black women who is a citizen of Jamaica? According to P.C. doctrine, she\\u2019s African-Jamaican, right? But if she becomes a US citizen, she\\u2019s a Jamaican-American. And yet if one of these language crusaders saw her on the street, he\\u2019d think she was African-American. Unless he knew her personally in which case he\\u2019d have to decide between African-Jamaican-American and Jamaican-African-American. Ya know? It\\u2019s just so much liberal bullshit. Labels divide people. We need Fewer labels, not more!I am an army brat.  That is someone who doesn\\u2019t really belong anywhere anymore, but has to fake it their entire life that they do.  But now I find that I am in the vanguard of the culture.  So many Americans have the same experience of being displaced and not belonging anywhere because of the widespread moving away from one\\u2019s roots that it has become normal.  So to feel we have roots we turn to things like pop music, which is now commercialized.  So our roots are not roots at all, but we are just consumers being manipulated by our own narcissism.Your email address will not be published.

Oh yeah. It all started in 1977. I mean, that\\u2019s when I started doing it regularly. How many times have you done it? Six times. I\\u2019ve done it six times. Why do you do it? I don\\u2019t know. It\\u2019s like I can\\u2019t help myself. What does your family think? Thank God my family doesn\\u2019t know. But how\\u2019d you get caught? They were taping me. Taping you?

Welcome to our show.\\nDon\\u2019t you think it\\u2019s just a little bit strange that Ronald Reagan had an operation on his asshole and George Bush had an operation on his middle finger, huh? Huh? What are these two men trying to tell us?Now I\\u2019d like to begin tonight with an opening announcement. Because of the FCC, I\\u2019m never sure what it is I\\u2019m allowed to say, So. So I now have my own official policy. This is the language you will not be hearing tonight. You will not hear me say, bottom line, game plan, role model, scenario, or hopefully. I will not kick back, mellow out, or be on a roll. I will not go for it, and I will not check it out. I don\\u2019t even know what it is. And when I leave here, I definitely will not boogie. I promise not to refer to anyone as a class act, a beautiful person, or a happy camper. I will also not be saying, what a guy. And you will not hear me refer to anyone\\u2019s lifestyle. If you want to know what a moronic word \\u201clifestyle\\u201d is, all you have to do is realize that in a technical sense, Attila the Hun had an active, outdoor lifestyle. I will also not be saying any cute things, like moi, and I will not use the French adverb tr\\u00e8s to modify any English adjectives, such as tr\\u00e8s awesome, tr\\u00e8s narly, tr\\u00e8s fabut, tr\\u00e8s intense, or tr\\u00e8s out of sight. I will not say concept when I mean idea. I will not say impacted when I mean effected. There will be no hands on state of the art networking. We will not maximize, prioritize or finalize, and we definitely will not interface. There will also\\u2026 There will also be no new age lingo spoken here tonight, no support group jargon from the human potential movement. For instance, I will not share anything with you. I will not relate to you, and you will not identify with me. I will give you no input, and I will expect no feedback. This will not be a learning experience, nor will it be a growth period. There\\u2019ll be no sharing, no caring, no birthing, no bonding, no parenting, no nurturing. We will not establish a relationship, we will not have any meaningful dialogue, and we definitely will not spend any quality time. We will not be supportive of one another so that we can get in touch with our feelings in order to feel good about ourselves. And if you\\u2019re one of those people who needs a little space, please, go the fuck outside! We will, we will, however, be talking about those little moments that seem to last forever. Have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass? Do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? Huh? Who, her? Oh, hell yeah. Well, it\\u2019s one of life\\u2019s little moments, isn\\u2019t it? It\\u2019s one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time. You can\\u2019t postpone that. You can\\u2019t put that off and be walking around like this. You\\u2019ve got to get in there and clear that thing out. You\\u2019ve got to rescue your underwear. There\\u2019s a letter in your mailbox. That\\u2019s right. And you have to rectify that situation so that you can move along to your next embarrassing moment, which is probably scheduled immediately. That\\u2019s the way life is, full of those little moments. Everybody knows them, everybody recognizes them. You ever been at a really loud party, I mean, a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly, and in order to be heard even by the person standing right next to you, you\\u2019ve got to be screaming at the top of your lungs. But every now and then at a party, it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time. And only your voice, can be heard. Right, I know. I know. Well, what I\\u2019m going to do, I\\u2019m going to have my testicles laminated. Life\\u2019s little moments. You ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt. And you have to just kind of keep talking, you know, and make believe it\\u2019s part of the design. Works all right if you\\u2019re wearing a Hawaiian shirt, but otherwise they\\u2019re going to notice. Ed, you got a big snot on your shirt. Some guys are really cruel, you know. And some of these things are not even your fault. These little things that happen, you didn\\u2019t cause the situation, a lot of time you\\u2019re the victim. You walk into some situation, and suddenly you\\u2019re the one who\\u2019s taking all the heat. Not your fault. Give you an example of the kind of thing I mean. Did you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guy\\u2019s hand and you suddenly realize he doesn\\u2019t have a complete hand? And you got to make believe it feels great, Right, you can\\u2019t go ahhhhhhhh, ahhhhhhhh! Ahhhhh! You can\\u2019t do that. It\\u2019s not even an option. You got to hang in there and say hi, hey, swell hand. Give me three. Hi 3, yo! Not your fault. You didn\\u2019t cause that. You weren\\u2019t even there when it happened to the guy.You were probably out walking your dog, which is what I\\u2019m usually doing, walking my dog. Because I love my dog. I love all my dogs. I love every dog I ever had. I remember them all, and I love every one of them, still love all my dogs. And I\\u2019ve had me a lot of God damn dogs. In my lifetime I have had me a bunch of different dogs. Because you do keep getting a new dog, don\\u2019t you? You just keep getting one dog after another. That\\u2019s the whole secret of life. Life is a series of dogs. It\\u2019s true, you just keep getting a new dog, don\\u2019t you? That\\u2019s what\\u2019s good about them, they don\\u2019t live too long. And you can go get a new God damn dog. Sometimes you can get a dog looks exactly like the dog you used to have, right? You shop around a little bit, you can find a dog identical to your former dog. And that\\u2019s real handy because you don\\u2019t have to change the pictures on your mirror or anything, right? You just bring the dead one into the pet shop, throw him up on the counter, say give me another one of them. That was real good. And they\\u2019ll give you a carbon copy of your ex-God damn dog. Now, my favorite dog that I ever had in my whole lifetime was Tippie. Tippie was a good dog. Some of you remember, I\\u2019ve talked about Tippie. Tippie was a good dog. Tippie was a mixed terrier. You know that word mixed that the veterinarian puts on the form when even he don\\u2019t know what the fuck you got. You bring in a little mixed puppy to a veterinarian and say, what is it? He\\u2019ll say, well, it\\u2019s definitely not a monkey. Tippie was actually part Dodge Dart. Poor Tippie was full of guilt, so much so in fact she\\u2019s the only dog I ever had who committed suicide. Yeah, well, we don\\u2019t say it like that around the house. We say she put herself to sleep. But she ran out in front of a milk truck. That\\u2019s fucking suicide. But that was her decision. That\\u2019s what Tippie wanted to do. And that\\u2019s the way it is in our family, if you want to commit suicide, we back you up. So we supported Tippie in her little suicide decision, then we brought her into the pet shop, threw her up on the counter, and said, give us something bigger. We\\u2019re trading up. We was looking for a bigger God damn dog. Because Tippie had been teenie, even before the truck came by. The truck had made her teenier, wider, but teenier. And we was looking for a bigger God damn dog. Not too big, you know, I don\\u2019t like a dog who\\u2019s bigger than I am. It\\u2019s bad enough looking for shit in one direction without having to duck flying turds as well. A good rule of thumb is keep the dog\\u2019s asshole below eye level. So we compromised, and we got us a mid-sized dog, knee high, just about like this size here, best size you can own, by the way. Most people know, this is the ideal size dog to have. You know why, anybody comes to visit you, the first thing that dog does is take his nose and put it right in their crotch. Oohh, oohh, he smells my dog. No, Marge, I don\\u2019t believe that\\u2019s the animal he has in mind. And people get embarrassed by that, especially the owner of the dog. The owner\\u2019s the one who\\u2019s saying stop that, stop that, will you stop that now, stop it. I\\u2019m awfully sorry about this. Not me, I say, get in there and get some of that. Get in there and sniff that thing out, go on. Listen, would you mind spreading your legs a little bit so he can get right in there? Yeah, stand like this for a little while, would you? Okay, looking good now. So how\\u2019s your mom and dad doing, anyway? Well, God bless them, it\\u2019s a wonderful couple. Go around the back, check it out in the back. Sniff that other thing in the back there. What\\u2019s that? Well, there\\u2019s two different smells he likes, what can I tell you. Don\\u2019t pay him no attention, he\\u2019ll be finished in just about half an hour. So listen, Reverend, it\\u2019s real nice of you to come and call on us like this. Every one of us is always glad to see you around here, especially that God damn dog. Those dogs are great, they\\u2019ll break the ice when a new neighbor comes to call. Hi, we\\u2019re the Johnsons. What\\u2019s his name? Ball Sniffer. He\\u2019s a crotch hound. Let me know if you want to get circumcised, he\\u2019s on duty till 5:00 o\\u2019clock. Dogs are a constant source of entertainment. Did you ever have a dog that ate cat turds? Some of them do, some of you must know that? Did you ever have a dog eat cat turds? Yeah. Of course you got to have a cat, you know. You can\\u2019t be buying cat turds at the supermarket. But it\\u2019s true, some dogs will eat cat turds, yeah. Don\\u2019t let them lick you that day. Get a bottle of Listerine for him. Try to make him gargle. Pour it down his throat and tell him to howl. Come on, howl, howl, God damn it. Stomp on his tail. Howl, I said, God damn it, howl. Oh, dogs are a lot of fun. Did you ever have a dog that ate a bunch of colored balloons and then he takes a shit and it\\u2019s real decorative like? Or sometimes at Christmas they\\u2019ll eat some tinsel and take a shiny shit. Wow, look, mom, can we hang it on the tree? Well, it is considered good luck in some cultures. Here\\u2019s a little household hint for you. This will help you clean up after your dogs. Feed your dog a lot of rubber bands. Put a lot of rubber bands in with his regular food, then when he takes a shit, there\\u2019s usually a little loop in the end of it. You just pick it up by the loop, do you know what I mean? Throw it in the neighbor\\u2019s yard. Yeah. That\\u2019s why I travel around, give these little household hints. Bet you never read that one in Heloise, huh?Yeah, about time for me to get a little drink of water. Figure this stuff is safe to drink. Huh? Actually, I don\\u2019t care if it\\u2019s safe or not, I drink it anyway. You know why? Because I\\u2019m an American, and I expect a little cancer in my food and water. That\\u2019s right. I\\u2019m a loyal American, and I\\u2019m not happy unless I\\u2019ve let government and industry poison me a little bit every day. Let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here. Ah. A little cancer never hurt anybody. Everybody needs a little cancer, I think. It\\u2019s good for you, keeps you on your toes. Besides, I ain\\u2019t afraid of cancer, I had broccoli for lunch. Broccoli kills cancer. A lot of people don\\u2019t know that, it\\u2019s not out yet. It\\u2019s true, you find out you got some cancer, get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli, that\\u2019ll wipe it right out in a day or two. Cauliflower, too. Cauliflower kills the really big cancers, the ones you can see through clothing from across the street. Broccoli kills the little ones, the ones that are slowly eating you away from inside, while your God damn goofy half-educated doctor keeps telling you, you\\u2019re doing fine, Jim. In fact, bring your doctor a bowel of broccoli, he\\u2019s probably got cancer, too, probably picked it up from you. They don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing, it\\u2019s all guesswork in a white coat. Here, let me have a few more sips of industrial waste. Ah, maybe, maybe I can turn them cancers against one another. That\\u2019s what you got to hope for, you know, that you get more than one cancer so they eat each other up instead of you. In fact, the way I look at it, the most cancer you got, the healthier you are. Well, I know, some people don\\u2019t like you to talk about those things, I know that. Some people don\\u2019t like you to mention certain things. Some people don\\u2019t want you to say this, some people don\\u2019t want you to say that. Some people think if you mention some things they might happen.Some people are really fucking stupid. Did you ever notice that, how many really stupid people you run into during the day? God damn, there\\u2019s a lot of stupid bastards walking around. Carry a little pad and pencil with you, you wind up with 30 or 40 names by the end of the day. Look at it this way. Think of how stupid the average person is, and then realize half of them are stupider than that. And it doesn\\u2019t take you very long to spot one of them, does it. Take you about eight seconds. You\\u2019ll be listening to some guy, and say, this guy is fucking stupid. Then, then there are some people, they\\u2019re not stupid. They\\u2019re full of shit. Huh, that doesn\\u2019t take very long to spot, either, does it. Take you about the same amount of time. You\\u2019ll be listening to some guy, saying, well, he\\u2019s fairly intelligent. Ah, he\\u2019s full of shit. Then there are some people, they\\u2019re not stupid, they\\u2019re not full of shit, they\\u2019re fucking nuts. Dan Quayle is all three, all three, stupid, full of shit, and fucking nuts. And where did he get that wife of his? Have you taken a good look at that Marilyn Quayle? Where did he get her, at a Halloween party or something? She looks like Prince Charles, for Christ\\u2019s sake. Let me ask you something, does he actually have to fuck that woman? Huh? God help him, I wouldn\\u2019t fuck her with a stolen dick.That\\u2019s my political humor. People like it when you\\u2019re topical. Oh, some people don\\u2019t like you to talk like that. Oh, some people would like to shut you up for saying those things. You know that, lots of people, lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk, tell you what you can\\u2019t talk about. Sometimes they\\u2019ll say, well, you can talk about something, but you can\\u2019t joke about it. Say you can\\u2019t joke about it because it\\u2019s not funny. Comedians run into that shit all the time, like rape. They\\u2019ll say, you can\\u2019t joke about rape. Rape\\u2019s not funny. I say, fuck you, I think it\\u2019s hilarious, how do you like that? I can prove to you that rape is funny. Picture Porky Pig raping Elmer Fudd. See? Hey, why do you think they call him Porky, huh? I know what you\\u2019re going to say, Elmer was asking for it. Elmer was coming on to Porky. Porky couldn\\u2019t help himself, he got a hard-on, he got horny, he lost control, he went out of his mind. Lot of men talk like that, lot of men think that way. They think it\\u2019s the woman\\u2019s fault. They like to blame the rape on the woman, say, hey, she had it coming, she was wearing a short skirt. These guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers. Don\\u2019t seem fair to me, don\\u2019t seem right, but you can joke about it. I believe you can joke about anything. It all depends on how you construct the joke, what the exaggeration is, what the exaggeration is. Because every joke needs one exaggeration, every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion. Give you an example. Did you ever see a news story like this is the paper? Every now and then you run into a story that says, some guy broke into a house, stole a lot of things, and while he was in there, he raped an 81-year old woman. And I\\u2019m thinking to myself, why? What the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have? I want to say, why did you do that? Well, she was coming on to me. We were dancing, and I got horny. Hey, she was asking for it. She had on a tight bathrobe. I say, Jesus Christ, be a little fucking selective next time, will you? Now, speaking of rape. You know what I wonder? I wonder is there more rape at the equator or the North Pole? These are the kind of things I think about when I\\u2019m sitting home alone and the power goes out. I wonder is there more rape at the equator or the North Pole. I mean, per capita. I know the populations are different. Most people think it\\u2019s the equator. I think it\\u2019s the North Pole. People think it\\u2019s the equator because it\\u2019s hot down there, they don\\u2019t wear a lot of clothing, guys can see women\\u2019s tits, they get horny, and there\\u2019s a lot of fucking going on. That\\u2019s exactly why there\\u2019s less rape at the equator, because there\\u2019s a lot of fucking going on. You can tell there\\u2019s a lot of fucking at the equator, take a look at the population figures. Billions of people life near the equator. How many Eskimos we got, 30, 35? No one\\u2019s getting laid at the North Pole, it\\u2019s too fucking cold. Guys say to their wives, hey, tonight honey, huh, tonight, huh? Are you crazy, the wind chill factor is 300 below. These guys are deprived, they\\u2019re horny, they\\u2019re pent up. Every now and then, they bust out, they got to rape somebody. Now, the biggest problem an Eskimo rapist has, trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman who\\u2019s kicking. Did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesn\\u2019t want to take them off? You would lose your hard on in the process. Up at the North Pole, your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes. That\\u2019s another thing I wonder. I wonder, does a rapist have a hard on when he leaves the house in the morning, or does he develop it during the day when he\\u2019s walking around looking for somebody? These are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schools.Now I probably got the feminists all pissed off at me because I\\u2019m joking about rape. Feminists want to control your language. Feminists want to tell you how to talk. And they\\u2019re not alone, they\\u2019re not alone, I\\u2019m not picking on the feminists, they got a lot of company in this country. There\\u2019s a lot of groups, lot of institutions in this country want to control your language, tell you what you can say and what you can\\u2019t say. Government wants to tell you some things you can\\u2019t say because they\\u2019re against the law. Or you can\\u2019t say this because it\\u2019s against a regulation. Or here\\u2019s something you can\\u2019t say because it\\u2019s a secret. You can\\u2019t tell him that because he\\u2019s not cleared to know that. Government wants to control information and control language because that\\u2019s the way you control thought. And basically that\\u2019s the game they\\u2019re in.Same with religion. Religion is nothing but mind control. Religion is just trying to control your mind, control your thoughts, so they\\u2019re going to tell you some things you shouldn\\u2019t say because they\\u2019re sins. And besides telling you things you shouldn\\u2019t say, religion\\u2019s going to suggest to you some things you ought to be saying. Here\\u2019s something you ought to say first thing when you wake up in the morning. Here\\u2019s something you ought to say just before you go to sleep at night. Here\\u2019s something we always say on the third Wednesday in April after the first full moon in Spring at 4:00 when the bells ring. Religion is always suggesting things you ought to be saying, same with political groups of all kinds, political activists, anti-biased groups, special interest groups are going to suggest the correct political vocabulary, the way you ought to be saying things, and that\\u2019s where the feminists come in.Now, as I said, I got nothing against the feminists. In fact, I happen to agree with most of the feminist philosophy I have read. I agree for instance that for the most part, men are vain, ignorant, greedy, brutal assholes who\\u2019ve just about ruined this planet\\u2026 Who\\u2019ve just about ruined this planet because they\\u2019re afraid someone might have a bigger dick out there somewhere. Men are basically insecure about the size of their dicks, and so they go to war over it. You don\\u2019t have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work. It goes something like this, what, they have bigger dicks? Bomb them. And of course, the bombs and the bullets and the rockets are all shaped like dicks. I don\\u2019t understand that part of it, but it is part of the equation. So I agree with that abstract, that man, men, males, have pushed the technology that just about has this planet in a stranglehold. Mother Earth, raped again, guess who? Eh, she was asking for it. I also happen to like it when feminists attack these fat ass housewives who think there\\u2019s nothing more to life than sitting home on the telephone drinking coffee, watching TV and pumping out a baby every nine months. Ba boom, ba boom, ba boom, ba boom, ba boom. Will seven be enough, Bob? Ba boom, ba boom. But what\\u2019s the alternative? What\\u2019s the alternative to pumping out a unit every nine months? Pointless careerism? Putting on a man tailored suit with shoulder pads and imitating all the worst behavior of men? This is the noblest thing that women can think of, to take a job in a criminal corporation that\\u2019s poisoning the environment and robbing customers out of their money? This is the worthiest thing they can think of? Isn\\u2019t there something nobler they can do to be helping this planet heal? You don\\u2019t hear much about that from these middle class women. I\\u2019ve noticed that most of these feminists are white, middle class women, they don\\u2019t give a shit about black women\\u2019s problems, they don\\u2019t care about Latino women. All they\\u2019re interested in is their own reproductive freedom and their pocketbooks. But when it comes to changing the language, I think they make some good points, because we do think in language. And so the quality of our thoughts and ideas could only be as good as the quality of our language. So maybe some of this patriarchal shit ought to go away. I think spokesmen ought to be spokesperson. I think chairman ought to be chairperson. I think mankind ought to be humankind. But they take it too far. They take themselves too seriously. The exaggerate. They want me to call that thing in the street a person hole cover. I think that\\u2019s taking it a little bit too far. What would you call a lady\\u2019s man, a person\\u2019s person? That would make a he-man an it person. Little kids would be afraid of the boogie person. They\\u2019d look up in the sky and see the person in the moon. Guys would say come back here and fight like a person, and we\\u2019d all sing, For It\\u2019s a Jolly Good Person. That\\u2019s the kind of thing you would hear on Late Night with David Letterperson. You know what I mean? So I think it\\u2019s an exaggeration, and I like to piss off any group that takes itself a little bit too seriously, and it does not take a lot of imagination to piss off a feminist. All you got to do is run into N.O.W. Headquarters or Ms. Magazine and say, Hey, which one of you cute little cupcakes wants to come home and cook me a nice meal and give me a blow job? Blow job. Oh, that pisses them off. You want to piss off a feminist, call her a cum catcher, that\\u2019ll get her attention. Ah, don\\u2019t act disgusted, don\\u2019t act disgusted, half of you are going to go home and go down on each other tonight, remember? If you\\u2019re willing to swallow cum, let\\u2019s not make believe something I said was disgusting, okay? All right. Let\\u2019s not have a double standard here, one standard will do just fine.Now, speaking of blowjobs. Do you know why they call it a blowjob? So it\\u2019ll sound like it has kind of a work ethic attached to it. Make you feel like you did something useful for the economy. Long as I\\u2019m being a complete pig up here, let me ask you guys a question. Let me ask one question of the men. Are you ever able to watch a woman eating a banana and not think about a blowjob, huh? I can\\u2019t do it. I can\\u2019t do it, and I know why, I\\u2019m a sick evil fuck, I know that. I accept that. But I can\\u2019t do it. Eating a banana, eating a pickle, licking on an ice cream cone. I\\u2019m saying to myself, look at the tongue on her, wow. So you women be careful when you\\u2019re standing out in front of that Hagen Daas, because God damn it, we\\u2019re watching. And God damn it, we\\u2019re thinking. Another woman\\u2019s issue, prostitution. I do not understand why prostitution is illegal. Why should prostitution be illegal? Selling is legal, fucking is legal. Why isn\\u2019t selling fucking legal? You know, why should it be illegal to sell something that\\u2019s perfectly legal to give away? I can\\u2019t follow the logic on that at all. Of all the things you can do too a person, giving someone an orgasm is hardly the worst thing in the world. In the Army, they give you a medal for spraying Napalm on people. Civilian life, you go to jail for giving someone an orgasm. Maybe I\\u2019m not supposed to understand it.I got strange ideas anyway. You know what I think they ought to do with that Miss American contest? I think they ought to make the losers keep coming back until they win. I\\u2019ll tell you. That would get a little spooky after about 35 years or so, huh? I just want to work on world peace. Fine, sit down before you fall down, will you? And pick up all these Goddamn batons. I got a lot of ideas. You know what I think? I think Kleenex ought to have little targets on them. Wouldn\\u2019t that be a good idea, little bulls eyes right in the middle of the Kleenex, make it kind of sporting when you\\u2019re with your friends. (Blowing nose sound) Look Dave, an 85. That\\u2019s a good idea. I got a lot of good ideas. Trouble is, most of them suck. I got a lot of good ideas for new products like that. That\\u2019s what I think about on my off duty hours, things we need, products we ought to have that we don\\u2019t have. You know what we ought to have, we ought to have a diet salad dressing called 500 Islands. See, good God damn ideas, like that, huh? A Christian deodorant, Thou Shalt Not Smell. How about a feminine hygiene spray called Sprunt. Huh? Well, you\\u2019d never forget the name, would you? It would always be on the tip of your tongue, see? Marketing, marketing, that\\u2019s where I belong, among other places. Marketing. Here\\u2019s an idea I got. This is a yo-yo with a 2,000-foot string. You use it when you visit the Grand Canyon. See, I\\u2019m a visionary, I\\u2019m ahead of my time. Trouble is, I\\u2019m only about an hour and a half ahead. Here\\u2019s a good idea, a light bulb that only shines on things worth looking at. Yeah, kind of too idealistic, never make any money on a thing like that. Here\\u2019s something that\\u2019s going to make you a fortune, get in on this. This is a roach spray, it doesn\\u2019t kill the roaches, but it fills them with self-doubt as to whether or not they\\u2019re in the right house. Yeah. Here\\u2019s something I\\u2019m trying to interest the Japanese electronics firms in this. This would be a great product for Sony. This is a combination cassette player and colostomy bag. It\\u2019s called Shitman. Huh? Sure. Well, you never see that. You never see that. You never see a guy jogging down the street, listening to a Shitman. No, that\\u2019s one of those things you never see. There\\u2019s a lot of things you never see. And you don\\u2019t know you don\\u2019t see them because you don\\u2019t see them. You got to see something first to know you never saw it, then you see it and say, hey I never saw that. Too late, you just saw it. I know things you never see. You never see a Rolls Royce with a bumper sticker that says, shit happens. You never see a really big tall, fat Chinese guy with red hair. You never see a wheelchair with the roll bar. You never see someone taking a shit while running at full speed. And you never see a picture of Margaret Thatcher strapping on a dildo. You\\u2019ll never see it. That\\u2019s one of those things you never see. Then there are some things you never hear, that makes sense. Some things you never hear. You never hear this, Dad, you really ought to drink more. Here\\u2019s something you don\\u2019t hear too often Do what you want to the girl, but leave me alone. Here is something no one has ever heard, ever, ever. As soon as I put this hot poker in my ass, I\\u2019m going to chop my dick off. You know why you never heard that? Right, no one ever said that. Which to me is the more amazing thing, no one ever thought to say that before tonight. I\\u2019m the first person in the world to put those words together in that particular order. First guy, number one. Here\\u2019s something you don\\u2019t hear too often, Honey, let\\u2019s sell the children, move to Zanzibar and begin taking opium rectally. Mom? Mom, I got a big date tonight, can I borrow a French tickler from you? Then there are some things you don\\u2019t want to hear. Some things you just flat don\\u2019t want to hear. You don\\u2019t want to come home from work and hear, honey, remember how we told the children never to play on the railroad tracks? You don\\u2019t want to be sitting in your doctor\\u2019s office and hear this. Well, Jim, there\\u2019s no reason why you shouldn\\u2019t live another 20 to 30 years. However, you will be bleeding constantly from both eyes. Here\\u2019s something I don\\u2019t want to hear, I\\u2019m pregnant, you\\u2019re the father, and I\\u2019m going to kill all three of us. Calm down, have some dip. Honey, it\\u2019s the police. They have a search warrant, and the 300 kilos of cocaine are still sitting out in the living room. Here\\u2019s something nobody wants to hear, nobody wants to hear this. Try to think back to when this was appropriate to your life. You and your fianc\\u00e9 have been invited to your mom and dad\\u2019s house for dinner for the first time. Halfway through dinner, your fianc\\u00e9 stands up and says, I\\u2019ll be right back. I got to take a dump. There seems to be no really gentile way of announcing publicly a dump. And frankly, I\\u2019m not impressed with people who tell me what they\\u2019re going to do when they go to the bathroom in the first place. Doesn\\u2019t it bother you, people that announce it, I\\u2019ll be right back, I\\u2019m going to take a shit. Never mind. Do what you have to do and leave me out of it, and don\\u2019t describe it when you come back. Boy, you should have seen\\u2026 Never mind. It set off the smoke alarm. Never mind. I have never understood that, nor have a cared for it.Something else I don\\u2019t care for, these organ donor programs. That shit bother you a little bit? Sounds like Josef Mengele\\u2019s been sitting on some of those meetings or something? Organ donor programs. The thing that bothers me the most about it is they\\u2019re run by the Motor Vehicle Bureau. I figure, hey, shit, you got to wait on a line that long for a kidney, fuck it, do without. It\\u2019s the Motor Vehicle Bureau in most states who send you the little card you\\u2019re supposed to carry right next to your wallet, right next to your driver\\u2019s license, in your wallet, little card. You\\u2019re supposed to fill it out and on it you\\u2019re supposed to list the organs you\\u2019re willing to give in case you die. Are these people out of their fucking minds or something? Do you honestly believe that if a paramedic finds that card on you in an automobile accident, he\\u2019s going to try to save your life? Bullshit, he\\u2019s looking for parts, man. Absolutely. Look, Dan, here\\u2019s that lower intestine we\\u2019ve been looking for. Never mind the oxygen, this man\\u2019s a donor. Bullshit, they want something of mine, they can have my rectum and my anus, that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m giving, take them and get out of here. Put them in your bag and get the fuck out of my life, that\\u2019s all I\\u2019m giving. I don\\u2019t want some guy poking around in me, hoping I die. I want to live. I don\\u2019t want to die. That\\u2019s the whole secret of life, not dying. I figured that shit out alone in third grade.And don\\u2019t be pulling any plugs on me, either. Here\\u2019s another bunch of macho asshole bullshit floating around this country, people talking about ah, pull the plug on me. If I\\u2019m ever like that, if I\\u2019m comatose, if I\\u2019m like a vegetable, pull the plug on me. Fuck you, leave my plug alone. Get an extension cord for my plug. I want everything you got, tubes, cords, plugs, probes, electrodes, IV\\u2019s, you got something, stick it in me, man. You find out I got a hole I didn\\u2019t know I had, put a fucking plug in it. Vegetable, shit, I don\\u2019t care if I look like an artichoke. Save my ass. There\\u2019s three things I want if I\\u2019m ever in that condition, three things I got to have, ice cream, morphine and television. You give me that ice cream every two hours, give me that morphine about\\u2026 every ten minutes, and turn on the fucking TV. I want to see Geraldo. And don\\u2019t be coming to visit me, I got no time for life people, I\\u2019m brain dead here. You people got no respect for the brain dead? Hey, you got to be brain dead to watch Geraldo in the first place. You might as well watch him when you\\u2019re clinically brain dead. There\\u2019s one other thing I thought about concerning this comatose thing, and this might help you someday. This little piece of information might come in handy sometime in the future if you\\u2019re in this circumstance. If you knew a family, if you knew a family and one of them was a homosexual and he was in an automobile accident and he was comatose, you could always comfort that family by saying, well, look at it this way, he was a fruit, now he\\u2019s a vegetable. Listen, at least he\\u2019s still in the produce section.Now I probably got some other group pissed off at me because I said fruit. There\\u2019s a different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything you\\u2019re not supposed to say. Can\\u2019t say fruit, can\\u2019t say faggot, can\\u2019t say queer, can\\u2019t say Nancy boy, can\\u2019t say pansy. Can\\u2019t say n*gger, boogie, jig, jiggaboo, skinhead, jungle bunny, moolie, moolie yan or schwarz. Can\\u2019t say yid, heeb, zeeb, kike, mackie, dego, ginny, wop, ginzo, greaser, greaseball, spick, beaner, oya, tiger, PR, Mick, donkey, turkey, limey, frog, squarehead, kraut, jerry, Hun, chink, jap, nip, slope, slopehead, zip, zipper head, gook. There is absolutely nothing wrong\\u2026 There is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves. They\\u2019re only words. It\\u2019s the context that counts. It\\u2019s the user. It\\u2019s the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad. The words are completely neutral the words are innocent. I get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language. Bullshit. It\\u2019s the context that makes them good or bad, the context that makes them good or bad. For instance, you take the word n*gger. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the word n*gger in and of itself. It\\u2019s the racist asshole that\\u2019s using it that you ought to be concerned about. We don\\u2019t care when Richard Pryor or Eddie Murphy says it. Why? Because we know they\\u2019re not racists. They\\u2019re n*ggers. Context. Context. We don\\u2019t mind their context because we know they\\u2019re black. Hey, I know I\\u2019m Whitey, the blue-eyed devil patio, fake gray boy, honkie, motherfucker myself. Don\\u2019t bother my ass. They\\u2019re only words. You can\\u2019t be afraid of words that speak the truth, even if it\\u2019s an unpleasant truth like the fact that there\\u2019s a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country. I don\\u2019t like words that hide the truth. I don\\u2019t like words that conceal reality. I don\\u2019t like euphemisms or euphemistic language. And American English is loaded with euphemisms, because Americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality. Americans have trouble facing the truth, so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it. And it gets worse with every generation. For some reason it just keeps getting worse.I\\u2019ll give you an example of that. There\\u2019s a condition in combat, most people know about it. It\\u2019s when a fighting person\\u2019s nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum, can\\u2019t take any more input. The nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap. In the First World War that condition was called shell shock. Simple, honest, direct language, two syllables. Shell shock. Almost sounds like the guns themselves. That was 70 years ago. Then a whole generation went by, and the Second World War came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue. Four syllables now, it takes a little longer to say, doesn\\u2019t seem to hurt as much. Fatigue is a nicer word than shock. Shell shock, battle fatigue. Then we had the war in Korea in 1950, Madison Avenue was riding high by that time, and the very same combat condition was called Operational Exhaustion. Hey, we\\u2019re up to eight syllables now, and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase, it\\u2019s totally sterile now. Operational Exhaustion. Sounds like something that might happen to your car. Then of course came the war in Viet Nam, which has only been over for about 16 or 17 years. And thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war, I guess it\\u2019s no surprise that the very same condition was called Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. Still eight syllables, but we\\u2019ve added a hyphen, and the pain is completely buried under jargon, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. I bet you if we\\u2019d have still been calling it shell shock, some of them Viet Nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time. But it didn\\u2019t happen, and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language, that language that takes the life out of life.And it is a function of time, it does keep getting worse, give you another example. Sometime during my life, sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue. I wasn\\u2019t notified of this, no one asked me if I agreed with it. It just happened.\\nToilet paper became bathroom tissue.\\n Sneakers became running shoes.\\n False teeth became dental appliances.\\n Medicine became medication.\\n Information became directory assistance.\\n The dump became the landfill.\\n Car crashes became automobile accidents.\\n Partly cloudy became partly sunny.\\n Motels became motor lodges.\\n House trailers became mobile homes.\\n Used cars became previously owned transportation.\\n Room service became guest room dining.\\n And constipation became occasional irregularity.\\n When I was a little kid, if I got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor. Now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization, or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional.\\n Poor people used to live in slums. Now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities.\\n And they\\u2019re broke. They\\u2019re broke. They don\\u2019t have a negative cash flow position, they\\u2019re fucking broke.\\n Because a lot of them were fired. You know, fired, management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area, so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce.\\n Smug, greedy, well-fed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins, it\\u2019s as simple as that.\\n The CIA doesn\\u2019t kill anybody any more. They neutralize people, or they depopulate the area.\\n The government doesn\\u2019t lie, it engages in disinformation.\\n The Pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call Sunshine Units.\\n Israeli murderers are called Commandos.\\n Arab Commandos are called terrorists.\\n Contra killers are called Freedom fighters. Well, if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire, what do Freedom Fighters fight? They never mention that part of it to us, do they? Never mention that part of it.\\nSome of this stuff is just silly, we all know that. Like on the airlines, they say they want to pre board. Well, what the hell is pre board, what does that mean? To get on before you get on?\\nThey say they\\u2019re going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance. Cripples. Simple, honest, direct language. There\\u2019s no shame attached to the word cripple that I can find in any dictionary, no shame attached to it. In fact it\\u2019s a word used in Bible translations, Jesus healed the cripples. Doesn\\u2019t take seven words to describe that condition. But we don\\u2019t have any cripples in this country any more. We have the physically challenged. Is that a grotesque enough evasion for you?\\nHow about differently abled? I\\u2019ve heard them called that, differently abled. You can\\u2019t even call these people handicapped anymore. They\\u2019ll say, we\\u2019re not handicapped, we\\u2019re handy capable. These poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition, somehow you\\u2019ll change the condition. Well, hey cousin doesn\\u2019t happen. Doesn\\u2019t happen.\\nWe have no more deaf people in this country, hearing impaired.\\n No one\\u2019s blind any more, partially sighted or visually impaired.\\n We have no more stupid people. Everybody has a learning disorder, or he\\u2019s minimally exceptional. How would you like to be told that about your child, he\\u2019s minimally exceptional. Oh, thank God for that.\\n Psychologists actually have started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficits.\\nIt\\u2019s getting so bad that any day now I expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient.\\n And we have no more old people in this country, no more old people. We shipped them all away, and we brought in these senior citizens. Isn\\u2019t that a typically American 20th Century phrase? Bloodless, lifeless. No pulse in one of them. A senior citizen. And I\\u2019ve accepted that one, I\\u2019ve come to terms with it, I know it\\u2019s here to stay. We\\u2019ll never get rid of it, that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re going to be called, so I\\u2019ll relax on that. But the one I do resist, the one I keep resisting, is when they look at an old guy, and they say, look at him, Dan, he\\u2019s 90 years young. Imagine the fear of aging that reveals, to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone, to have to use an antonym. And fear of aging is natural, it\\u2019s universal isn\\u2019t it. We all have that. No one wants to get old, no one wants to die, but we do. So we bullshit ourselves. I started bullshitting myself when I got to my 40\\u2019s. Soon as I was in my 40\\u2019s I\\u2019d look in the mirror and I\\u2019d say, well, I guess I\\u2019m getting older. Older sounds a little better than old, doesn\\u2019t it. Sounds like it might even last a little longer. Bullshit, I\\u2019m getting old, and it\\u2019s okay, because thanks to our fear of death in this country I won\\u2019t have to die. I\\u2019ll pass away. Or I\\u2019ll expire like a magazine subscription. If it happens in the hospital, they\\u2019ll call it a terminal episode. The insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome, and if it\\u2019s the result of malpractice, they\\u2019ll say it was a therapeutic misadventure. I\\u2019m telling you, some of this language makes me want to vomit. Well, maybe not vomit, makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spill.Thank you all.

              "'* sometimes listed as On Location: George Carlin at PhoenixPerformed at the Celebrity Star Theater in Phoenix on July 23, 1978Hi, this is George Carlin, and I thought we might take a look at some of the pictures from the days when my show business career was just starting. This is one of the earliest photos of my days as an actor. Here I’m playing the part of a baby in an early production of a play called “Hold Onto The Rail.” As proof of the intensity I brought to the role, lying nearby you can see a doll that I had recently strangled. This is a candid photo of my first manager and I having a business conference in the park, where we knew we couldn’t be bugged. In this photo I am trying out a new funny face that I had been working on for about six months. Now, here I am with, uh, two of my fellow actors from the West Harlem production of either Ben Hur or the Sound of Music. You can’t really tell from what we’re wearing there because those are our street clothes. And the person off to one side is our personal manager who insisted on being in all of our publicity photos. This is a rare photo, uh, this is a photo of me in a singing group called The Mills Brothers. Uh, we didn’t know that there was already a group in existence by that name. The Mills Brothers sued us, so we dropped two guys and changed the named to Mickey and Sylvia. This is a picture of the time I came in second in a suntan contest. The boy in the middle won, but it was, uh, later he was disqualified when it was discovered he had been using pep pills. Uh, this is the same photo with the negative reversed. As you can see, the suntans are approximately the same on the back. This is me during an early suicide attempt. I was despondent at that time because my puberty was coming along very slowly. This one was taken during the nationwide search for a replacement for Lassie. I remember this picture. I’m trying to get my dog Spotty, a fox terrier, to stand up straight and act like a collie. Uh, although he didn’t get the part, later he did go on to become Mars the Cat God, rest his soul’s manager. This is a picture of me and the boy who doubled for me during my early film career. Normally I did all my own stunts except for the scenes involving homosexuality, of course, and this boy served that purpose. This is me singing in a trio I had started which was called The Inkspots. Oddly enough, the NAACP sued the trio and forced me to drop out when I couldn’t prove there was such a thing as flesh colored ink. This is my first communion picture. It was so well received that I decided to use it for publicity, and to this day, this is the picture that I send out when producers call and ask me if I’m interested in serious acting.And that brings me to today, here in Phoenix, Arizona, where we’re going to shoot one of these comedy shows for the first time in the round. So I’ll see you around. All right, now, I’m starting to feel it Marty. Let’s go, Marty. All right. No, I want to do like, this is what guys who run do, sprinters do this, 60-yard dash. I always wonder if they’re gonna run on their fingers or what. Okay, getting ready to go. Hey, how are you there? Okay, we’re getting ready to go. We’re getting ready. All right, we’re going to hire you on good judge of character. Hi, how are you? Looks like you made it all the way out to the van during half-time. That’s good. Any time. What? Go. I can go out, on-stage? Yeah. Oh, all right. Ah, yes, thank you. Thank you. Very nice, thank you very much. Well, thank you. Well, I do thank you. And you all got here. Imagine that, we all got here. That’s what always knocks me out about the audience, the audience comes from everywhere. Audiences come from all different houses, different apartments, all over town, different rooms. Imagine that, you had to leave your room and come on to the theater. Maybe you had to drive here, that’s how a lot of us got here. You had to get in and drive the big iron thing, trying real hard not to hit anyone else in the other big iron things. But we got here. Now, all we have to do is get back again. I do think about the audience, though, I’m in the audience, too. You know, I mean, I feel like I’m in the audience, I just happen to have the best seat in the house, that’s all. I am in the audience, and I know the things you think of. I think of them too. When I’m driving to the theater going to be in the audience I’m thinking to myself, what kind of a member of the audience will I be tonight? Will I be a credit to my row? Will we win row of the year? Suppose we get some shit from another section? If there’s a fire drill, will I file out safely, or trample the shit out of my neighbor? Pardon me, fire, look out, fire, pardon me, fire, fire, look out, pardon me, fire. We never practice that one, do we, panicking. We never practice panicking, we practice going out neatly, pardon me, fire, look out, pardon me, fire, fire, yeah, pardon me, fire. We never do that, I don’t know why we practice so much. If we could learn to climb over one another, we might save a few lives.I wonder, I wonder a lot of things. I wonder what it’s like when I’m not there. Do you wonder what it’s like when you’re not there anymore, when you’re gone? You know, you were somewhere, you were over here with your friends and you’re talking some shit with them. You say we’ll see you later, Phil, we’re going downtown, and then you leave. Do you wonder what it’s like over there now? I wonder are they gonna treat me right while I’m gone? What’s it like? I wonder a lot of things, but that’s my job. My job is thinking up goofy shit. You know, that’s my job, thinking up goofy shit. My job is to think up stuff and come around and remind you of it. Cause you already knew it, you just forgot to laugh at it, that’s all. My job to remind you. I wonder about things like, I wonder if on a rainy night the sandman sends the mudman. You’d think it would be his job. I wonder why we don’t have any large craft warnings. Apparently we don’t care about the big boats, huh? I wonder why Marineland doesn’t have a display of fish sticks. I mean, it’s a seafood, I’d like to see it. In fact, I’d like to see Mrs. Paul herself come swimming by. Hi, boys. I wonder if a centipede wants to kick another centipede in the shins, does he kick one leg at a time, or does he stand on 50 and kick with 50? I wonder why there are not waiters in waiting rooms. They’re all in the restaurant. I wonder why women wear evening gowns to nightclubs. Why don’t they wear nightgowns? And I wonder why fluorescent lights seem afraid to come on. Have you ever noticed, you turn them on and they go blip, blip, blip, blip, blip… finally they’ll come on after you coax them a little. I wonder why Kleenex doesn’t have a target in the middle of it. Don’t you think we need a bulls-eye right in the middle of the Kleenex? I wonder about hats. Did you ever notice that when you have a hat on for a long time, it feels like it’s not there. And then when you take it off, it feels like it’s still there. That’s creepy. I wonder about frog’s legs. In those restaurants where they serve frog’s legs, what do they do with the rest of the frog? What, do they just throw it away? I mean, they don’t have frog torsos on the menu. They must be doing something with them. They throw them away. Can you imagine a barrel full of frog bodies in the restaurant and some drunk coming down the alley, oh, goddamn. I wouldn’t wanna see that. I wonder about who empties wishing wells. Who the hell empties the wishing wells? That’s our money. I’ve never seen an accounting. Does anybody ever tell you, no, gone, just gone. Someone picked it up, someone emptied the well. I’m sure they don’t come around at 3:00 in the afternoon on Sunday with a little girl in her first communion dress dropping a dime. 3:00 in the morning, black T-shirts empty the wishing well. It’s our money and I want some of it back. I wonder if movie directors have credits on their dreams. And I wonder why there’s no blue food. Where the hell is the blue food? Every other food is represented… I mean, every other color, every other color is represented. I mean, every color… okay, red is raspberry, cherry and strawberry, orange is orange, yellow is lemon, green is lime, brown is meat. There’s no blue food. Why the hell was blue left out of the food thing? Somebody’s got the blue food, goddammit. Somebody’s got it. It probably bestows immortality, that’s why we haven’t been given any. And don’t say blueberries, we know they’re purple. You look at a blueberry and you see that sucker is purple. Bleu cheese, no, bleu cheese is just white cheese with a bunch of mold in it, man. And bluefish, God knows, you open one up they’re every color under the sun. Well, enough of that shit. I wonder, I wonder which came first, skilled workers or unskilled, and who decided? I figure originally all we had was workers, and then they decided, this is hard. And they called themselves skilled. And someone else came along they couldn’t do it, poor unskilled son of a bitch. They moved right past his ass, man, when he was just in the landing area. Do you think maybe Charlie McCarthy has little wooden balls? I’ve always wondered that. Hi, Charlie, hi, Charlie. You know what I wonder about, I wonder we buy flowers. Why do we buy flowers? They’re free. They grow all over. Yet, we buy them, we pay good money for flowers, flowers that are dying, I might add. That’s a little strange, flowers is one, flowers is one of the few things that you buy, you bring it to your house, and if they die you don’t give a shit. Normally, you’d be asking for your money back on anything that died. Are you kidding me, these things keeled over on the piano. Flowers. I wonder why I’ve never seen anyone cleaning a church. Have you? I’ve never seen someone cleaning a church. A lot of things go on in church. You never see a cleaning crew going in there with pails and mops and shit. It just never happens. Why don’t they clean churches? You know why? Churches don’t need to be cleaned, they clean themselves overnight. That’s how they know they’re churches. Come back the next morning, shit, it’s still clean, must be a church.Does the time bother you? I get bothered by the time. Not so much the time itself, the people bother me for the time. People come up to me on the street, I’m sure you’ve had this happen to you, people come up to you and say what time it is, or they might say what time is it? I shouldn’t get into these ballads. You’ve had people come up to you and say, what time is it? What time is it? As if you personally were responsible for keeping time. You know, I feel, I feel honored, first of all, that they thought I was the man in charge. But I do have to explain, you don’t see official timekeeper on here, do you? I don’t have the time of course not. Do you have the time? That’s another way they say it, do you have the time? I say, uh, no, I don’t believe I do. I certainly didn’t have it this morning. Did you leave it somewhere? Well, do you have the time? No, I don’t have the time. I use a little of it like everyone, you know, but I don’t have it. I think, I think the Navy has it, in Washington. Isn’t that, they keep it in an observatory, that’s right. Sure, they let out a little of it each day. Not too much, they wouldn’t want to give us too much, just enough time. Sometimes they’ll say, do you know what time it is? And I say, yes. I hate to disappoint them, but there is no time. There is no time. I don’t mean there’s no time, I mean there’s no time. When the hell is it? We made that whole thing up. There’s no time, we made it up. It’s a manmade invention, time. There are no numbers up in the sky. I’ve looked, they’re not there. We made this stuff up, when is it? When the hell is it, when are we, I ask you, when are we? Sometimes we think we know where we are, but we don’t really know when we are. When the hell is it? All the time zones are different, every calendar you run across is different. They’ll all give you a different answer. These are calendars, these are made to… to keep track of time. Everybody’s got a different one. The Chinese are way up there in the 5 and 6000’s, Hebrew calendar is way up in the 5 and 6000’s, we’re up at about 1977. Well, shit, this ain’t a couple of weeks these people are off, this is thousands of goddamn years that are missing, man. How did they do that? We don’t, we don’t know when the hell is it, it could be the middle of last month, for all we know. I mean, time is so, we’ve got it down so perfect that every four years we have to stick in an extra day just to make sure it still works, and we call it February 29th. Bullshit, it’s March 1st and I know it. It just feels like March 1st. You can’t keep track of the time, what’s the sense. Give you an example, there’s a moment coming, it’s not here yet, it’s still on the way, it’s in the future, it hasn’t arrived, here it comes, here it is, oh, shit, it’s gone. There’s no now, there’s no now, everything is the near future or the recent past. But there’s no present. Welcome to the present, whoosh, gone again. It’s just so imprecise. We don’t even care to use the minutes and seconds and hours that we’ve been given, everybody’s very vague about the time. They say what time you got, I got, uh, I got just after. Just after, geez, I must be slow, I had going on. And where did that imprecision begin? Why is it we’re not so sure? I know one of the clues that happened to me was when they started telling me about moments when I was a kid. They were trying to teach me how to tell time, and of course, you can’t tell time, time tells you. But they were trying, they were trying to show me. Now the big hand, I said I don’t have a big hand. Never mind, look at the clock. And the clock is so wonderful, there’s so much emotion attached to a clock face. I hate digital clocks. Digital clocks rob me of all the emotional experience of the spatial relationships on that face of the clock. Isn’t it true, I mean, don’t you always feel that this half hour when it comes down from 12 down to 6 goes by a lot quicker than this half hour when it has to come up fighting gravity all the way? I know, it does go a lot quicker, yeah. Oh, I got ya, yeah. I’ll tell ya, I’ll tell ya this, if I only have a half to live, I want it to be this one, man. I wanna last just a little bit longer than this one here. It’s vague, that’s all I’m saying, it’s very vague how we treat time. We have all these wonderful expressions, we say now, now is an interesting one. When, now, you want that now? Yes. Well, would you like to try again. Or sometimes just now, just now, did you hear that? What? Just now. You must mean just then, don’t you? Yes, just then, but there it goes again. When? – Now? – No, not now. Pardon me, do you have the time? When do you mean, now or when you asked me? This shit is moving, Ruth. We got a lot of these vague terms, right away, immediately, at once, lickety split, just like that, nothing flat, drop of a hat, no time at all, as quick as you can say Jack Robinson. I’m sure you’ve done that to people, I’ll be back before you can say Jack Robinson. Jack Robinson, you’re not back. How about, a jiffy, a jiffy, or a flash? Which is quicker? A jiffy or a flash? I think there are two flashes in a jiffy, myself. But God knows how many jiffies there are in two shakes of a lamb’s tail. And why did they use two shakes of a lamb’s tail, what’s wrong with the basic unit of measurement, one shake of a lamb’s tail? We can do our own arithmetic, thank you. Belched a little there. Tried to swallow that one. Then we have words like soon. Soon, that’s a very emotional word, there’s a lot of potential for drama in that word, soon. Soon, soon, is your mother coming home? Uh-huh. When? Soon. Real soon. As soon as she can. Sooner than you think, that’s kind of a spooky one, Sooner than I think? That’s a little bit like before you know it. I’ll be back before you know it. He did it, holy Christ, look at that. And we go on with these terms that we use, these vague terms of time, one of these days, before long, any time now. Well, that’s true, everything is gonna happen any time now. Any day now, that’s kind of a snotty one, any day now. Hey, I’ll be giving you that five bucks I owe you, Bill. Yeah, any day now. Sooner or later, now and then, once in a while, from time to time, in a little while. In a little while, that will just be a little while. That’s a wonderful one, and I just love that. It sounds so benign, just a little while. Couldn’t hurt you, could it? You can wait a little while. It’ll only be a little while longer, just a little while. That’s so different from a short time. Short time sounds sound almost terminal, doesn’t it? You only have a short time. Whereas you have a little while. Oh, I’d rather have a little while than a short time. You know, we’ve got long ways we measure time, we’ve got vast distances of time we measure. People will say things like kingdom come, I’m… I’m gonna be standing here till kingdom come. Shit, I don’t have that on my watch. Doomsday, you say? Doomsday. Till the cows come home. Now, that’s an easy one to understand, that’s long about dusk, isn’t it? If you leave them out overnight they’d burst. Here’s a long period of time, forever. Some people will tell you, gosh, I’ve been standing on this line forever. Look at this, Dave, this man has been standing on line forever. He looks fairly fresh to me. Almost like an eternity, people will tell you, it’s… it’s almost like an eternity, as if they had experience with eternities. Now, you must have a favorite period of time. I have some favorites, I just want to try a few of them on you. It isn’t easy, uh, to select a favorite period of time, so many of them are attractive, but there are little periods of time that, um, that you might relate to. Of course, the most basic period of time I feel is five minutes. That seems to be the one everyone chooses. If they need to think of a period of time real quickly, they just go five minutes, just five minutes, I’ll be there in just five minutes, give me five minutes, would you please just, would you just give me five minutes? Are you kidding me, I can fix that shit in five minutes. Five minutes, that’s all most people want, five minutes, a good, solid, nice period of time. You can do anything for five minutes, can’t you? I mean anything. Even things you really hate. Yeah, you can probably do it for five minutes. Hey, let’s go talk to Ted. Are you kidding? Ted’s an asshole. Look, just five minutes, huh? Okay, let’s give him five minutes. Not ten, ten I can’t make, now you’re getting into double digits, you’re starting to fool with my head. Time, five, ten minutes. Fifteen minutes is popular, you hear fifteen quite a bit. But it’s, it’s sort of an institutional one, it’s kind of an official time period, 15 minutes. Has a touch of regulatory, uh, quality to it, doesn’t it? It sounds like something you’re not supposed to do, or have to do for 15 minutes. Fifteen minutes. I like 20 minutes. Doesn’t that sound free compared to 15, 15 minutes? Twenty minutes. I’ll be back in 20 minutes. Gosh, what’s he gonna do?Do you have those news stories for me? Maybe let’s go to the news reports, man. Tell us what’s going on around the world. God knows you’re not home to find out. Thank you, thank you, Walter, let’s do it. I just want to keep you up to date, there’s a few things that have happened while we’ve been sitting here, and it’s not nice to ignore the rest of the world. Let’s take a look, I’d like to take a look at the news. First of all, the headlines, three Shriners have been killed in a whoopee cushion explosion, 21 killed in 21-gun salute, rapist swallows whistle. Oh, the head of the lost and found has been reported missing. And a vegetarian has been beaten to death by a meat packer. Oh, some vegetarians? Have I been ignoring your section? I’m really sorry. Well, we’ll be okay, though, cause, um, you know, I just can’t think of everything. But I’m now, I’m gonna do about 10 straight stories just for these folks here. Back into the news.

The Surgeon General announced today that saliva causes stomach cancer. However, only when swallowed in small amounts over a long period of time.

The other four got away by running completely across Canada. A man who was shot in the chest nine times yesterday and refused treatment… died today… of nine shots in the chest. A man in Cincinnati is suing a hospital, claiming he entered the hospital for a vasectomy and was castrated instead. When the chief surgeon was asked how such a mistake might happen, he said, well, it all started out as a joke. We were pretending we were going to castrate him and he got real snotty so we offed his balls. The man himself was philosophical about it, he said well, it’s just that much less to wash. Tragedy struck the parade today as an open manhole claimed the lives of 1200 marchers, one at a time. A man who shot and killed all 12 members of a jury which convicted him last year, goes on trial again today. A set of Siamese twins which was surgically separated six months ago was sewn back together again today because each of them only knows one half of the combination to their locker. A man who has… a man who was… this is kind of one where you’re gonna moan, but I’m gonna do it anyway. Okay, a little pre-moaning, that’s nice. Visine, do they look that red? Would you hold that for me. Oh, hey, now I need it, now I need it. It’s like starting a fire for the charcoal burner, you know? God, well, that’s gonna be nice, That’ll really… Well, anyway, would you hold them both for me. Now you’re under arrest. Here comes the Wisine, as we say, in the middle part of Europe. Well, there ain’t much of this left, but there is one final story that I would like to wind up with, folks, and I do thank you for that Visine, but I didn’t smoke at half-time, so if they’re red, it’s just natural eyeball blood pressure, or whatever you call that shit. I was, the one you were gonna moan about, I was gonna tell a man… about a man who was scheduled for a heart transplant who decided not to have it. He had a change of heart, you know? I love that shit, that’s why… I know why you’re moaning, because you wish you had thought of the goddamn thing yourself. I have to think that. Like to wind up the news tonight with sort of a little story, kind of a human interest story about man’s best friend. It seems that 65-year-old James Driscoll was asleep in his downtown hotel room last Wednesday when he was awakened by the sound of a dog barking. When he woke, he found the room was full of smoke, he could not see, and the dog led him out of the room, down the hall, and into an elevator shaft where he plunged eight stories to his death.I want to do a… a nostalgic thing here for my own sake and for the request of a couple of people that are on the crew that are listening or looking through viewers, or listening on headsets or whatever, and do a little, uh, weather forecast from Al Sleet, Al Sleet, the hippy-dippy weatherman. Hey, baby, what’s happening. Que pasa? Que what you call your pasa? Al Sleet here, your hippy-dippy weatherman, with all the hippy-dippy weather, man. Brought to you by Parson’s Pest Control. Do you have termites, waterbugs and roaches? Well, Parson’s will help you get rid of the termites and waterbugs, and help you smoke the roaches. Hey. Temperature at the airport is 88 degrees, which is stupid, man, cause I don’t know anybody who lives at the airport. Now if you’ll take a look at our national weather map, you’ll see that we don’t have one. So try to picture last night’s map in your mind. Remember all the letters and lines, all them little numbers. The weather is dominated by a large Canadian low, which is not to be confused with a Mexican high. Tonight’s forecast, dark, continued dark tonight, turning to partly light in the morning. Old Al, Al got out of the weather business and he’s, uh, he’s now a, a linoleum, uh, quality control inspector in a linoleum plant. Al, he only wanted to get out of the media. You know, he said fuck it, I don’t need it. And, uh, hey, who can blame him. I don’t know, but Al got out of weather when he realized he had given the… the final weather forecast. He had given the ultimate forecast, there was nowhere to go. You know, when there’s nothing left to conquer in your field, hey, it’s time to leave. And old Al had given the ultimate forecast, he told us, he said one night that the weather will continue to change on and off for a long, long time. Then he was gone from it. God bless Al.Okay. Yes, you’re all, you’re all going to die. Didn’t mean to remind you of it, but it is on your schedule. Yes, it probably won’t happen when you want. It usually comes along when you’re not expecting. Generally you have your stamp collection out, you know? Now? Now. Just want a little time to put away your hinges, you know? No, there’s a time to die, and it’s okay, you know? It’s really okay. Nobody wants to die, nobody. Well, you know, ha ha, most people don’t wanna die. Nobody wants to die. Boy, if you think being sick is no fun, dying is really a pain in the ass. Nobody wants to die. People don’t mind being dead, being dead is great, but getting dead, nobody wants to get dead. So I hope I don’t die. I wonder how often we think that, you know? It’s just under the surface, isn’t it? You go out for the day, going out of your house, geez, I hope I don’t die. It would really spoil the circus if I were to die. Geez, I hope I don’t die. Comedians don’t wanna die. It’s only a metaphor, but it’s true of all of us, we don’t wanna die out there. A comic’s gonna die, I don’t want to die. Geez, I was dying out there, I was dying, it was death out there. It was like a morgue. I don’t wanna die. Of course, if the comedian doesn’t die, you know? If he succeeds, if he makes you laugh, then he can say, I killed ’em. I killed ’em. So, it’s either me or you, you know, just like on the freeway. Yeah, dying shouldn’t be that bad, it shouldn’t be that bad. We’re all gonna do it, it’s one of the few fair things in life, everybody catches it once. And dying should be fun, there should be some sort of a look ahead. I mean, after all, when you die you’re gonna find out where you go. Haven’t we been wondering about that a long time, where the hell we go. Isn’t that the biggest thing we have to wonder about, where the hell do you go? I don’t know. Joe thinks he knows. I know Joe thinks he knows, but Joe don’t know. Where do we go? Nobody knows. Well, I think sometimes you go where you think you’re gonna go, whatever you think you’re gonna do, that’s where you’re probably gonna go. If you keep saying you’re gonna go somewhere, chances are you might go there. You ever hear those guys say, I’m going to hell, don’t pray for me. Don’t pray for me, I’m going to hell. He is. You go where you wanna go. I think when you die, your soul goes to a garage in Buffalo. When Monte Hall dies, he’ll go behind Door Number 4. That’s it, where you wanna go. No, nobody wants to die, and you know part of the reason we don’t wanna die is because of that goddamn funeral. We’ve seen it, we know how bad news it is. That funeral is no fun. Man, if I don’t like other people’s funerals, I know I’m not gonna like my own, man. There’s no way I can get behind my own funeral. Gonna be lying there in a casket, they’re gonna put me in the box, gonna put me in a convertible with the top down. You know that’s embarrassing, lying there and everybody’s looking at you. You’re dead, and they’re looking. You’re just lying there still, people coming over going… they don’t know that you’re lying there with short pants on and no back in your jacket, embarrassing. And sometimes they’ll come over, you know, some people it depends on your religion and so forth, but they do come right over to the casket a lot of times and they’ll go like this. And they’re silent for a moment, and what they’re doing while they’re silent is, they’re subtracting their age from your age, so they get a rough estimate on what they have left. And they get up and they say, don’t he look good? Don’t he look good? You crazy, he’s dead. I know, but he never looked that good. Well, they say the nicest things about you, they say the nicest things when you die. Your popularity goes straight up when you die. They say the greatest things there are that can be said, they’ll even make stuff up if they have to. Well, he was a real asshole, but he meant well, you know? He was a well-meaning asshole. Yes, you get so popular when you die, all the flowers you get, think of the flowers you get when you die. You get more flowers when you die than you got in your whole life. All your flowers arrive at once, too late. And guys will say, oh, yeah, well, you know Bill is dead, yeah, poor Bill, poor Bill is dead, yeah. Poor Dave, yeah, poor Dave is gone now. Ed, yeah, poor Ed is gone. Dan, that motherfucker is still alive, isn’t he? I wish he would die so I could like him. Reincarnation is another aspect of death that a lot of people will tell you little tales about it. Reincarnation, coming back, a lot of folks are sure of it, they can come back, you come back as something. I don’t know, does it seem right to you that it would work? I mean, mathematically, it doesn’t seem to work, because originally on this earth we only had, well, let’s say six people. I know we had two, but it’s a controversial number. Let’s say at one time there were only, there were only six of us, about, six people, six souls. And those six people died, and those souls went back to the staging area, and new people were born and those six souls came back. We still only have six souls. Now, we have four billion people claiming to have souls. Where are all these extra souls coming from? Someone is printing up souls, and it lowers their value. The more souls there are, the less they’re worth, it would seem. Well, somebody’s got to think of this shit, you know? How about the perfect murder, I’ve thought sometimes about the perfect murder. You know what you do, you pick up one person by the ankles and you beat another person to death with him. And they both die, and there’s no murder weapon, hey. What happened here, sergeant? Looks like a pedestrian accident to me. They must have been moving at quite a clip. Of course, if you should be caught with this perfect murder in progress, or even after the fact, if you should be caught you might wind up on death row. Death row, wow. That’s more than just fun, ain’t it? I mean, there’s cats there, death row, man, shit. Oh, well, you got that one meal, but that’s not much of a consolation, is it? You’re gonna get to order your meal, big deal. Why don’t you leave me alone, I’m not hungry, man. They give you that one last meal. I say, you can have some fun with that last meal. I mean, if you work it right. They gotta give you whatever you want. I mean, short of elephant steak, you know? They don’t wanna start on a new elephant just for one guy. But they gotta give you pretty much what you want, that’s part of the humanity of what they’re going to do to you. Yeah, you could just order something, you know, like maybe, well, shit, you tell them you can’t decide. That’s it, I can’t decide. I don’t know, I don’t know if I want steak or lobster, you know? I mean, I really love them both and I honestly can’t decide. Could they kill you? I don’t think they could kill you if you honestly couldn’t decide. Lie detector, truth serum, the man honestly doesn’t know what he wants. We can’t very well kill him, we can’t drag him down the last mile screaming, I don’t know what I want. You gotta give him a chance, and then he… well, man lives. Imagine if you worked it out and you kept it going six months, man is still alive, can’t decide on meal. Three years, eight years, and then finally you’re an honest person so you tell them when you do figure it out, and you say I’ve decided what I’d like, I think I’ll have steak. Okay, how did you want that? Oh. Well, my feeling is, if you’re gonna die, you know, or if you know, hey, die big. Die big. Nobody wants to just pass away. You don’t want to be a euphemism, do you? Nobody wants to pass away. You know, Arnie passed away. Oh, really? Yes. Well, I didn’t know that. Well, that’s the idea. On the other hand, Dave died. Oh, yes, I heard about Dave dying. That’s true. I say die big, give it a shot, man, go out big, it’s your chance. Die big, work in a few posthumous reflexes for your friends. Give them a show before you go. Entertain and uplift and instruct those you are leaving behind. When you die, give them a few posthumous reflexes. You know, the body does store electricity up, there’s a certain storage of electricity, and even a dead body, a corpse, will occasionally go (sound). And I say if you have that potential after you’re dead, use it properly. Pre-program, before you die, pre-program some posthumous reflexes that will be entertaining to those you’ve left behind. Do something to capture their imagination, roll over on the autopsy table. That’s nice. Cross your legs, scratch your balls, do something. Now, the only reason, the only reason that I even suggest that you have a choice about what you can do at the moment of death, is a very little known and very little understood part of the death process called the two-minute warning. Many people are not aware of it at all, the two-minute warning. Just as in football, two minutes before you die you receive an audible warning, two minutes, get your shit together. The reason we don’t know about it is because the only people who hear it, die. And I don’t think we’d believe someone anyway if he told us he’d received his two-minute warning, would you? Some asshole on the bus, hey, I just got my two-minute warning. You’d think it was a coach out on the town, you know? But no, the two-minute warning does arrive, and I say use that time to entertain, to leave something behind. Do something with the two minutes, hey, if nothing else give a speech, a little two-minute speech. We can all give a little two-minute speech. Just pick some subject you’re very fond of and talk about it for two minutes, I mean, tell them. It’s your last chance to tell them anything, so tell them. You got two minutes, and I mean wax eloquent, rise, bring it to the rafters. And then at the moment of the end you say, if this is not the truth, may God strike me dead.Well, that leads me into the filth, and, uh, to kind of wind up. Thank you. You know, that’s the trouble with it, is trying to decide what to call these words, man. I’m trying to decide what to call this whole thing. You know, what are these words that I’m talkin about, they’re just words that we’ve decided, sort of decided not to use all the time. That’s about the only thing you could really say about them for sure, that they’re just some words, not many, either, just a few, that we’ve decided well, we won’t use them all the time. Sometimes, well, hell yeah, sometimes it’s okay, but not all the time. And they’re the only words that seem to have that restriction. I mean, there are a lot of words you can say whenever you want, you know, pneumonia. Nobody gives you a lot of… all right, you can’t yell it in the hospital a great deal, but what the hell. There are words that you can say, no problem. Topography, no one has ever gone to jail for screaming topography. But there are some words that you can go to jail for. There are some words that we just have decided we will not say all the time. Sometimes, okay, if you’re running through the jungle chasing somebody that we’re at war with you can holler them. If you’re shooting a criminal it’s okay, it’s the all American thing, dirty, fucking crook. But if you’re with the bishop’s wife at lunch, it’s better not to ask for the goddamn lettuce. You know what I mean, it’s just like we’ve decided there’d be some words we won’t say all the time. And I was just trying to find out which words they were, for sure, all of them. I wanted a list. Cause nobody gives you a list, that’s the problem, they don’t give you a list. Wouldn’t you think it would be normal if they didn’t want you to say something to tell you what it is? Nobody even tells you when you’re a kid what the words are that you’re supposed to avoid. You have to say them to find out which ones they are. Shit, ahhhh. Oh fuck, ahhhh. That’s two. Oh, ma, that’s enough trial and error, huh? Please, ma, give me a list, huh? All right, you’re six years old now, and here’s the list of words your dad and I don’t ever want to hear you say. Oh, hey, thanks ma. Boy, that’s gonna save me an ass kicking or two. Ahhhh, ohhh. Yeah, you never know what’s gonna be on the list, cause it’s always somebody else’s list. You didn’t make that up, somebody told you that shit. They told you, better… better not say that, so you’re gonna… and you don’t know what’s gonna be on their list. God, people’s lists even change from day to day. Some people on Friday night got a list, you know, about two or three words. Sunday morning, goddamn, there’s 27 words on it. These are the same people, two days later, different list. So you’ve gotta kind of watch out what you’re gonna believe from them. The trouble is, I was trying to find out what these words might be, and I wanted to know the ones that you could never say on television. I mean, the filthy words that are always filthy. There are a lot of these little two-way, double entendre words that have two meanings, words that they’re okay part of the time. I call them like, part-time filth, some of these words, they’re only 50 percent dirty. You have words like ass. Ass is hardly even a dirty word anymore, but it has a few meanings that you can’t say on television, that’s what I was talking about, what can you say on television. That’s another one of those places where we can’t use these words all the time. But some of them are all right, some of the time. Ass is all right on television. You can say on television things like, well, you’ve made a perfect ass of yourself tonight. But you can’t say, hey, let’s go get some ass. Bitch, bitch is another word like that, same kind of word, it’s only dirty part of the time, depends on what you mean by bitch. You might be the lady from the San Diego Zoo visiting one of the Tonight Shows, and you might just have a bunch of little canines with you there. One of them is a female, and you say there’s the bitch, Johnny. And it’s okay, fine. Just don’t refer to the singer the same way, that’s all. Is that bitch gonna do another number? Yes. Animals are fine on those two-way words. And that’s it, that’s what I was trying to find, the words that were always dirty not just part of the time, but completely filth. Well, in… in looking for these words I kept finding new categories. We have so many ways of describing these dirty words, it’s, well, we have more ways to describe dirty words than we actually have dirty words. That seems a little strange to me. It seems to indicate that somebody was awfully interested in these words. They kept referring to them, they called them bad words, dirty, filthy, foul, vile, vulgar, coarse, in poor taste, unseemly, street talk, gutter talk, locker room language, barracks talk, bawdy, naughty, saucy, raunchy, rude, crude, lewd, lascivious, indecent, profane, obscene, blue, off-color, risque, suggestive, cursing, cussing, swearing. And all I could think of was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits, man. That’s all we have, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. That was my original list. I knew it wasn’t complete, but it was a starter set, you know? …mention WBAI? Shit, piss, fuck… yes, WBAI is the one who played them… shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker and tits. Now, that was the original list. We’ve added a few words since then, we’ve added fart, turd and twat. And I know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about, why they haven’t been considered, why they haven’t shown up on the list thus far. We’re looking at them all very closely. Some of your favorites might make the list this year; asshole, ballbag, hard on, piss hard, blue balls… nookie, snatch, box, pussy, pecker, peckerhead, peckertracks, jism, joint, donicker, dork, poontang, cornhole and dingleberry. Dingleberry, a very popular word. And to my way of thinking, dingleberry a rather innocent sounding word, dingleberry, sounds Christmasy to me, you know? Let’s put one on the tree, dad. So, the words, as I say, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Now, motherfucker came off the list immediately. The first day in fact I had a call from an English language purist, some guy had to, he had to talk, you know? He got on the phone. He tells me I have a duplicate on the list, I have a duplication. He says motherfucker is a duplication of the word fuck, technically. Because fuck is the root form, motherfucker being a derivative, therefore, it constitutes duplication. And I said, hey, motherfucker, how did you get my phone number anyway? How did he know I even had a phone? I said look, man, it may be a derivative, but you still can’t say it. You still can’t say motherfucker on TV, can you? He said no, but you can’t say fuckee, fucking, fuckola, fuckarooni or fuckarino, either. Well, I said, yeah, that would crowd up my list something awful. So I just struck that motherfucker away. I struck it from the list, motherfucker was gone. Now, the list was shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Does is sound like something’s missing? Does it sound like an old friend is gone? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits. Remember the old rhythm? Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits. Now, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits, it falls apart. It isn’t going anywhere. And by now, cocksucker is the dominant word on the list. Previously, with motherfucker on the list, cocksucker was somewhat balanced out. They were the only multi-syllabic words on the list. But now cocksucker stands alone, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, tits, And who knows, maybe it doesn’t belong either. After all, motherfucker turned out to be a ringer, let’s take a look at cocksucker, see if this one belongs. We’ll divide the word cock and sucker from each other, those words. Sucker isn’t dirty, sucker, it’s suggestive as hell, but it isn’t dirty. And cock, that’s not dirty all the time, that’s one of those words that’s only partly filthy. Cock, if you’re talking about the animal, it’s perfectly all right. They used to read that to us from the bible in third grade, and we would laugh, man. Cock is in the bible. Remember the first time you heard about a cock fight. What? No. Get out of here. Get out of here. Even the word cocksucker itself has been twisted out of all of its original meaning, it’s been distorted. For some reason now, cocksucker means bad man. It’s a good woman, how did they do that? How did they do that? Well, tits is on the end of the list, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits. And you know it doesn’t belong on that list. I mean, it really doesn’t belong in with that kind of heavy-weight filth. Tits isn’t dirty, tits is a cute name, cute thing, cute idea, great fun, good name. Tits, hey, tits sounds like a friend. It sounds like a nickname, doesn’t it? Hey, Tits, come here man. Hey, Tits, I want you to meet Toots. Tits, this is Toots, Toots, Tits. Tits, cute word, nice word. I love a word that spells the same forwards and backwards like tit. Don’t you think it’s cute when a word is spelled the same forwards and backwards? I always wished my name was Otto, just so I could walk backwards and yell my name, you know? Otto, Otto, Otto, well, I had strange dreams. But the word tit is on the list because you can’t say it on television. You can’t say tit, imagine that, can’t say tits. You can say boobs. Boob is spelled the same forwards and backwards, too. Boobs is all right. You can’t say tits, but you can say boobs. In fact, boobs is an answer now on Match Game. I had boobs, Gene. Boobs, $200, tits, $200 fine maybe. You can’t say tits. You can say teats, teats is all right, providing you’re on at 5:00 in the morning and a cow is your guest. But you can’t say jugs, and you can’t say knockers, you know? That’s right, Danny, pull on the cow’s knockers. Right, grab a knocker in each hand, that a boy. Now alternate knockers, good deal. You can’t say that. Tits, tits sounds like a snack, you know? Well, I know what you’re thinking, but tits sounds almost, it sounds Nabisco to me. It sounds like Nabisco has… has reserved that name. Cause tits sounds like a thing at a party, pass the tits, would you, Bill? Say, those things are… responding. Well, shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits, fart, turd and twat. Fart, fart is like tit, it’s one of those words that isn’t that harmful. You know, it’s just a cute kind of a thing. Farts, well, farts can be a little harmful, it depends, it depends on who’s cooking. But, fart, fart is a cute… hey kids know farts are okay. Kids know farts are fun. Farts are shit without the mess, wow. Yeah, same funny sound, same vile smell, no fuss, no muss. Fart is an interesting word in this respect, talking about television, fart is extremely interesting because, dig this, you can’t say fart on television, we know that. You can’t say fart. And you can’t say fuck, either, on television. However, you can refer to fucking, you can talk about fucking, they do that all the time. Some of the times in the show you’re watching two people are probably fucking in the other room. Fucking is all right, fucking is part of the plot. A lot of plots are based on fucking. Will they fuck, should they fuck, have they fucked, did they fuck, will they fuck again, will they get sick from fucking, are they fucking too much, will they fuck each other’s friends, will they have a baby from fucking, will they be sorry they fucked, will they be glad they fucked? All fuck stories, every honeymoon joke is a fuck joke. Have you ever noticed it? Otherwise the people wouldn’t be on their honeymoon in the joke, they’d be knights or they’d sailors or something. They’re on their honeymoon, it’s got to be a fuck joke. Every little, every news… I’m sorry… every quiz master has stood there with his newlywed couple and said, and I understand you folks are on your honeymoon. Lots of fucking going on here, Lots of fucking over here. So they talk about fucking all they want, they just don’t call it that. They don’t call it what it is. They call it other things, they call it making love, which is fine, they call it going to bed with someone, having an affair, sleeping together, but they don’t call it fucking. On the other hand, fart, not only is fart a word you can’t use on television, but they never even refer to them, that’s how bad farts are compared to fucking. They don’t even refer to farts, there are no farts on television. You’ve never seen a reference to a fart, I’ve never seen a fart reference. No, wouldn’t you think that by now one guy would have gone, whew, whew. Do you think by now that one guy on the Johnny Carson panel just once would have said, hey, Ed, move down, man? Whew, wow. That was a Clydesdale fart, Ed. Give me the lighter, will ya, Johnny, wow. Geez, Ed, next time you’re sick you ought to see the nurse, you know? God, it’s not the smell so much, it’s the burning of my eyes. Well, we might live to see that, you never know. Remember when you were a kid, and maybe you were a little boy child like me, you had on short pants, maybe sitting in church, sitting on a wooden bench in church in the middle of the summer with short pants. You gotta fart, you know? And it’s up to you, you gotta work out a little maneuver that’s called the one cheek sneak. Right in tune with the organ. That’s why they call them pews, you know? Whew, whew, whew. Did you ever notice that your own farts smell okay? Say, that’s fairly decent. I think I’ll stay home today, do some reading in the closet. Now I mentioned the three extra words, fart, turd and twat. Turd is another word you can’t say on television, turd. But, you know, when you get right down to it, who wants to say it? I don’t even care if I ever hear that one again. Twat, twat is on the list for the same reason. It doesn’t mean anything else, you know? It only has that one meaning, twat’s twat, and that’s that. It’s not like prick, prick is one of those part-time dirty words. Prick is all right, you can say prick on television. You can say I pricked my finger, just don’t say you fingered your prick, that’s all. Now there are two words left which I will wind this thing up with, one of them is not, uh, dirty all the time, one of them is. Ball or balls is a word that’s mostly clean. It has many clean meanings, but… but it has a couple of meanings that might get you in trouble. And ball is one of those words you gotta think about how you’re gonna say it, and maybe you have to watch out for just a moment, but it’s okay for sports people, perfectly all right. When you’re a kid you grow up, they tell ya, go play with your ball. Really? But it’s okay for the sports announcer on the Game of the Week to tell you that Pete Rose has two balls on him, no problem at all. The whole country nods in agreement. But the announcer can’t tell you that he hurt his balls. He can’t tell Tony Kubeck, Tony, I think he hurt his balls on that play. It looks like it, he’s holding onto them. Well, that’s right, generally when they hurt their balls, they hold them, and he’s holding his, and I’d say he’s hurt them. Never mention ball injuries, they don’t say the balls were hurt, they say groin injuries. He had a groin injury. Do you know why we call it a groin injury, that’s the noise you make when you get hit there. Groin. Now, then, the other word I wanted to remind you of was the word fuck, which of course is the champ of the all-time dirty words. When they’re always dirty, by God, fuck is right at the head of the pack. Fuck’s a good, strong word. It’s a good, strong word for its purpose, and it’s a word that a lot of people have trouble with. Uh, it’s a… it’s an honest word, it’s a… it’s a forceful word, it has a lot of emotional baggage with it. When you hear the word fuck, you’re not just hearing the word, you’re hearing everything you ever heard about fucking. I mean, we have a lot of attitudes about fucking, some of them are rationale, and some of them aren’t. Some of them have joy in them, some have guilt and fear and all sorts of things, and the word fuck carries with it a lot of emotional baggage. When they say fuck. You go what, oh, oh, good. Oh, I thought you meant do it right away. God, you know, it’s, uh, it’s just a word that, that, well, it’ll clear the room awfully quick in some households. It’s a heavy, good, strong word. It’s a proud sounding word to me. Fuck, fuck, I am fuck. Who are you? Fuck of the Mountain. I just, uh, I just feel the word is getting a bad shake. The word has an image problem. The word fuck needs public relations help. It’s just a word, you know? That’s what you have to remember, it’s just a word, but it’s in such bad shape. Here’s a word that started out okay, it started out all right, nothing wrong with the word fuck originally. I mean, there it was, you’re not a bad word, you’re not a bad word, you’ve just gotten in with bad company, people. That’s all, just the word was all it was. The word in the original old English, as best I can find, fuck only meant to hit, to smite, to… to perhaps hit with a stick, to fuck the tree, to fuck the rock, to fuck thee. That’s all, and pretty soon, that’s all, I’ll hit you with my dick, honey. Look at that, that’s all it was, just a little, I’ll knock a little fuck on you there. That’s all it was, was a love tap when you get right down to it. That’s all fuck ever meant. All fuck ever meant was to make love, and to make life at the same time. That’s pretty magic. I mean, pretty noble things we think about, making love and making life, here was fuck hanging around with words like love and life. How did it get such a bad reputation? We fucked it up. Yeah, well, we… we put the aggression back into the word. Fuck you, fuck you, you fuck. Fuck you, you fuck. Who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with, some kind of a fuckhead? Fuck you. Who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with, me? Don’t fuck with me, I’ll fuck over you. You fuck with me and you’ll get fucked, you fuck. Don’t fuck with me, I’m the fucker. Don’t fuck with the fucker. God, it sounds like combat, man. It’s got an awful lot, there’s an awful lot of hostility in the way that word is used. There’s an awful lot of aggression going down in the name of fucking, imagine that. I’d just like to help a little, my feeling was, hey, here’s a word that, uh, maybe we could save, you know, just by paying a little close attention to it. The trouble is with all that aggression and all that violence, that we lose track of those two things, and people start talking about sex and violence like they’re one thing. There’s some sort of an overlapping, there’s some sort of a gray area between sex and violence that some people really are confused about. There are people running around talking about sex and violence as if it’s one thing, as if it starts with an S and ends with a E. We’re gonna stamp it out of the comics, we’re gonna stamp it out of the Dixie Cup, we’re gonna stamp it out of homes. Sex and violence, hey, they are different, after all. And, some people even like them together, there are, true, people who do like a little violence with their sex. I’m not… I don’t care for that myself, I like my violence a little earlier in the afternoon, you know? Right around 2:00 o’clock a real good ass kicking and then everything’s all right. But, uh, the word make love, not war, someone pointed it out finally, they made it very clear for us. Make love, not war. I wish I had thought of that phrase, you know? I really would have been very happy with myself if I had thought of that one. Man, I would have retired the same day. I would have left my car at the red light, man. I’d say that’s it, folks, I’m going to the beach. You got it, make love, not war. Well, I didn’t think of it, but I do have my own phrase; make fuck, not kill. It’s not as graceful a phrase, but I’m not looking to retire, either. The whole idea of make fuck, not kill, is simply to switch the meanings of the words. I suggest that for one year we trade meanings on fuck and kill, just fuck for kill, and kill for fuck, that’s it. Don’t worry about what they really are, someone else will take care of real fucking and real killing. I’m just worried about what we call it… them. We call them fucking and killing. I say switch them around. I think it would be an insight, I think we’d get a new slant on how we feel about these words if we just change fucking for killing for about a year, that’s all. Imagine it. Sure would be fun watching TV during that time, huh? Better get down off the horse, Sheriff, we’re fixing to fuck you now. Mad fucker still on the loose. Not anymore, he’s made his first big mistake, my friend, he fucked a cop today. That makes him a cop fucker. Pardon me, boys, my horse broke his leg, I’m gonna have to fuck him, I’ll be right back. Shamu, the fucker whale. And To Fuck a Mockingbird, hold gently by the wings. So all I’m trying to suggest is that fuck you can be a positive phrase. If you hear it from across the street… Fuck you. Okay.And thank you for being a part of this, and I mean it a lot. And I thank the people that aren’t here tonight that were here the other two nights. And there’s an awful lot of people to thank, but I want to do one thing before I go any further, cause I am gonna split. There’s somebody that’s very important to this project and to me. Brenda, would you please come here? I want to introduce you to my wife of 17 years. She is the associate producer, and she is my honey, and if she don’t come out here now, come here, honey, I want you to give me a kiss. My wife Brenda Carlin. Come here, honey. Thank you, lover. See you later. Thank you all, and goodnight, I love you, and fuck you.Your email address will not be published.

the women who are against abortion are women that you wouldn\\u2019t want to fuck in the first placethank you very much ladies and gentlemen good evening my name is george carlin and i am a professional comedian as opposed to the kind you run into at work all day long it\\u2019s nice being a comedian there are uh certain advantages naturally and a few disadvantages there are some drawbacks to being a comedian no one on death row has ever said \\u201cbefore i die i wanna talk to a comedian\\u201d you ever hear anyone at the scene of an accident say \\u201cquick call a comedian for god sakes\\u201d but it would be kind of fun at an accident to push your way through the crowd and say \\u201cmay i be of help i\\u2019m a professional comedian\\u201d and sooner or later at least once in your life when the policeman says to you \\u201cwhat are you a comedian\\u201d you\\u2019ve gotta look him right in the eye and say actually yes even criminals have no respect for comedians what do they say first thing they do when they hold you up \\u201cdon\\u2019t try anything funny first one makes a funny move gets it\\u201d whenever they\\u2019re not looking i go well that\\u2019s my job thinking up goofy shit thinking up goofy shit coming around every now and then letting you know what it is or reminding you of things you already know but forgot to laugh at the first time they happened we all have things like that you hear it during the day and then you don\\u2019t remember it at all for instance i\\u2019ve noticed they have disposable douche and i\\u2019m wondering who would want to keep it in the first placei do have a lot some not a lot but i have some notes over here and uh the reason for that is i haven\\u2019t been doing this lately i want to make sure i know and remember everything tonight i\\u2019ve been taking a little time off six months i think i took uh three of them uh quite voluntarily and the other three quite against my will i had a heart attack or as they say in boston i had a heart attack he had a heart attack you hear about george he had a goddamn myocardial infarction i had a heart attack fortunately my pharmacist my cardiologist and my doctor give me cpr but i would like to bring you up to date uh on the comedian\\u2019s health sweepstakes as it stands right now i lead richard prior in heart attacks two to one i am ahead i am ahead that\\u2019s right now however richard still leads me one to nothing on burning yourself up well the way it happened was first richard had a heart attack then i had a heart attack then richard burned himself up then i said fuck that i\\u2019m gonna have another heart attacki had an interesting morning got into an argument\\u2026 got into an argument with my rice krispies i distinctly heard \\u201csnap crackle fuck him\\u201d i don\\u2019t know which one of them said it i was reaching for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl but i told them i said well you can all just sit right there in the milk far as i\\u2019m concerned you can sit in the milk until i find out which one of you said that a little mass punishment for my breakfast food the idea is to turn them against one another just sit in the milk far as i\\u2019m concerned silly me big punishment that\\u2019s what they do anyway sit in the milk that\\u2019s their job that\\u2019s rice krispies\\u2019 job sitting in the milk you\\u2019ve seen them haven\\u2019t you floating along little beige blisters of air riding proudly in the milk but you can\\u2019t sink them they float for a long time and you know why they stay together they gather together in little groups little groups of eight ten twelve sometimes fourteen but always an even number if you\\u2019ve noticed it\\u2019s the polarity of the krispies that attracts them they form little colonies of rice krispies but you can\\u2019t sink them you try to sink them with a spoon they come up over the sides you can\\u2019t sink them that\\u2019s what the fruit is for sinking the rice krispies good size peach will take down  or  of them if i\\u2019m really pissed i\\u2019ll drop a watermelon on thembut i say interesting about my morning \\u2019cause it was it\\u2019s not\\u2026 i don\\u2019t have a nice day anymore i don\\u2019t bother much with that i think i\\u2019m beyond that now i think i\\u2019ve outgrown the nice day i think i\\u2019ve had my share why should i be hogging all the really nice ones let somebody else have a few of course everybody still wants me to have one everybody wants me to have a nice day have a nice day yeah yeah yeah wanna give me my fucking change please i\\u2019m triple parked some of them are really insistent i said have a nice day all right all right goddammit all right i\\u2019ll give it a shot that\\u2019s the trouble with have a nice day it puts all the pressure on you now you\\u2019ve gotta go out and somehow manage to have a good time all because of some looselipped cashier have a nice day maybe i don\\u2019t feel like having a nice day maybe just maybe i\\u2019ve had  nice days in a row and i\\u2019m ready by god for a crappy day i never hear that let them wish one of them hey have a crappy day thank you and to your wonderful family as well a crappy day hey that would be easy it\\u2019s no trouble at all a crappy day just get up there\\u2019s no planning involved for a crappy dayi know what it is that bothers me about that whole thing it\\u2019s the word nice it\\u2019s just a weak word it doesn\\u2019t have a lot of character you know nice isn\\u2019t he nice oh he is so nice and she\\u2019s nice too isn\\u2019t that nice how nice they are i don\\u2019t care for that you know that\\u2019s like fine there\\u2019s another word how are you fine bullshit nobody\\u2019s fine hair is fine how\\u2019s your hair fine that makes a lot more sense to me some guys are great did you ever meet those guys great isn\\u2019t this great goddamn this is great look they\\u2019re kill that guy isn\\u2019t that great that\\u2019s great no not me i\\u2019m not nice i\\u2019m not fine i\\u2019m not great people ask me how i am i say i\\u2019m fairly decent i don\\u2019t give them any superlatives nothing to gossip about relatively okay sometimes i\\u2019ll say i\\u2019m moderately neato if i\\u2019m in a particularly jaunty mood i\\u2019ll say i\\u2019m not unwell thank you that pisses them off because they have to figure that one out for themselvesso\\u2026 it reminds me of something my first grade teacher used to say to me a little lady she used to say you show me a tropical fruit and i\\u2019ll show you a cocksucker from guatemala no that that was someone else that was someone else i think it was someone i met in the army always confuse them i don\\u2019t know what it isever been looking through the refrigerator and come across an empty plate well that starts me to wondering i think did something eat something else maybe the olives ate the peas maybe that chicken isn\\u2019t really dead and he\\u2019s grazing on my stuff actually i picture a little mouse with gloves and a parka on you know just\\u2026 just waiting for the lights to go out so he can get back to work i guess the worst thing that can happen cleaning out or looking through the refrigerator is to come across\\u2026 something\\u2026 that you cannot identify\\u2026 at all you literally do not know what it is it could be meat it could be cake usually at a time like that i\\u2019ll bluff honey is this good well what is it i don\\u2019t know i\\u2019ve never seen anything like it it looks like meatcake well smell it actually it has no smell whatsoever it\\u2019s good put it back somebody is saving it it\\u2019ll turn up in something that\\u2019s what frightens mei was what they called a fussy eater he\\u2019s fussy he\\u2019s a fussy eater fussy eater is a euphemism for big pain in the ass i mean if i didn\\u2019t like something i told them i didn\\u2019t play with my food pick at my food i said i don\\u2019t like that you make this i don\\u2019t like it why they wanted reasons well you don\\u2019t always have a reason i don\\u2019t know i know i don\\u2019t like it and i know that if i ate it i would like it even less you like it you eat it then they would try to corner me with logic how do you know you don\\u2019t like it if you\\u2019ve never even tried it came to me in a dream big pain in the asssome things i didn\\u2019t like just because of the sound of the foods to this day i can still not eat\\u2026 yogurt yogurt it sounds like it\\u2019s coming up again yogurt yogurt i can\\u2019t eat anything with a y and a g in it something else that doesn\\u2019t sound so good squash you want some squash shit

people don\\u2019t know that they say hitler geez he had a lot of balls\\u2026 onefor some time i was trying to get a list of words together that would fairly represent the dirty words cause nobody gives you a list of dirty words for life have you noticed that there\\u2019s some words that are perfectly clean but sound like they could be filthy if you gave them just a little help a word like pussyfoot it\\u2019s perfectly clean but when you say pussyfoot there\\u2019s a little giggle cause people know that with a little help this word could be filthy no matter what form of the verb you try it\\u2019s clean as a verb but pussyfoot could be a noun it could be a noun pussyfoot a rare disorder a female birth defect hello boys i have pussyfoot god you sure do lady and i love them opentoed shoes you have on well i\\u2019d rather have pussyfoot than woodpecker i can say thator beer nuts god that must be awful beer nuts the official disease of milwaukee i know whenever i see the little canister behind the bar i drop in a couple of dollars for beer nuts i think we need a lot more research on beer nuts or cotton balls which is the dreaded final stage of beer nuts when my beer nuts turn to cotton balls i\\u2019ll be heading home to you it\\u2019s an old southern hymnlots of little phrases like that in the language that don\\u2019t quite say what they mean take a shit is another one take a shit you don\\u2019t take shit you leave a shit that\\u2019s the whole idea to leave it i left a shit fine thank you jeff where\\u2019d you leave it in the icebox i\\u2019m gonna take a shit don\\u2019t take one of mine i only have two left and the weekend is coming up why don\\u2019t you go home and take one of your own shits guy\\u2019s always mooching off me he must think i\\u2019m made of shit or something boy that shit don\\u2019t grow on trees you know well enough of that shit lots of little phrases like thatpick your nose is well blow your nose blow your nose is a phrase imagine that blowing your nose i don\\u2019t believe they really mean that do you you can\\u2019t blow your nose i believe it\\u2019s physically impossible to blow your nose you might get somebody else to blow your nose but it would have to be a real good friendcocktails another clean word you can advertise them you can put up signs all over town cocktails as long as you use both halves of the word perfectly fine but you can\\u2019t advertise either one of those two items if you break those words in half they\\u2019ll come and take your sign down cocktail it\\u2019s okay it depends on how you say that kind of word you ladies like some cocktails hey lady you want a cocktailcockpit men will actually laugh about that cockpit get it oh yeahbangkok there\\u2019s a lovely city how would you like to be a hooker in bangkok it would seem like a natural habitatpeacock nbc is really proud of their peacock you know what a female peacock is a peacuntmy list i was just trying to isolate the words that were always filthy not the ones that were sometimes dirty and the original list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits this was all i could think of in one sitting just one try but we had to add some we had shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and then we added fart turd and twat which also don\\u2019t have other meanings you know twat\\u2019s twat and that\\u2019s that but after a while it didn\\u2019t take long well it took quite a while but i finally discovered that there are only two words on the list you really had to deal with to sort of look at the double standard that television uses where language is concerned uh the two words were fart and fuck those are the only two they seem similar because you can\\u2019t say either one of them you can\\u2019t say fart and you can\\u2019t say fuck no matter how cleverly you try to work them in no matter how clinical the conversation is fart and fuck will not show up on the final tape you simply cannot say them but that\\u2019s where the similarity ends cause at least with the word fuck even though you can\\u2019t say the word fuck you can talk about fucking oh you can refer to fucking there\\u2019s lots of fuck talk going on on tv they just don\\u2019t call it fucking that\\u2019s the secret they don\\u2019t use that word there\\u2019s plenty of fuck talk you see people who wrote a book about fucking you\\u2019ll see a guy on a talk show who wrote a book about fucking how to fuck who to fuck when to fuck why to fuck and how to feel after you fuck this man is a fuck expert and he wrote a fuck book and he\\u2019s talking to merv griffin about fucking and they\\u2019re getting away with it cause they don\\u2019t call it fucking same with the soap operas everybody you take a look at a soap opera and you know everybody is fucking somebody on a soap opera and if they\\u2019re not fucking somebody they\\u2019re trying to fuck somebody will he fuck her did he fuck her has he fucked her should he fuck her can he fuck her some more will they fuck too much will they get silly from fucking who is fucking who that\\u2019s all you want to know is what the fuck is going on on this program here you know that somebody is getting fucked and you think it\\u2019s you so there\\u2019s lots of fuck talk and there\\u2019s plenty of fucking on television they just don\\u2019t call it fucking they call it everything elsenow on the other hand farts not only can you not mention the word fart but you can\\u2019t refer to farts at all that\\u2019s how bad farts are they\\u2019re worse than fucking you never hear anybody talking about farts on tv you\\u2019ve never seen a guy who wrote a book on farts how to fart who to fart at how to feel after you fart there\\u2019s no fart experts on the merv griffin show you don\\u2019t see any farts or fart references it\\u2019s a fart free zone wouldn\\u2019t you think after  years one guy by now would have gone whew just once just once i\\u2019d like to see someone on the johnny carson panel say hey ed move down man that was a clydesdale fartwell anyway uh after a while i realized that i was needlessly restricting myself to seven words and only to the ones that weren\\u2019t allowed on tv i mean there were a lot more to be looked at and television isn\\u2019t the only place that objects to your language sometimes there are lots of situations where you\\u2019re not supposed to say that so i expanded the list by as many as i could and i\\u2019d like to share some with you now this list is a little longer than it was before first we start with the ones we already know shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat crap balls prick asshole jackoff jerkoff scumbag

county fairs in the \\u2019 to watch his dad perform and his mom going to the wrong house to pick up his daughter\",\n          \"i know i\\u2019m a little late with this but i\\u2019d like to get a few licks on this totally bogus topic before it completely disappears from everyone\\u2019s consciencesfirst i want to be really clear about one thing as far as other people\\u2019s feeling are concerned\\u2014especially these \\u201cvictim groups\\u201d\\u2014when i deal with them as individuals i will call them whatever they want when it\\u2019s one on one if some guy wants me to call him a morbidly obese africanancestored male with a same gendered sexual orientation i\\u2019ll be glad to do that one the other hand if he wants me to call him a fat ngger  than that\\u2019s what it will be i\\u2019m here to pleaseif i meet a woman who wishes to be to be referred to as a motionimpaired same genderoriented italianamerican who is difficult to deal with fine on the other hand i am perfectly willing to call her a crippled guinea  cnt if she prefers i\\u2019m not trying to change anyone\\u2019s self image but but when i am speaking generally and impersonally about a large group of people i will call them what i think is honest and fair and i will not try and bullshit myselfokay so who exactly are these victims well first of all i don\\u2019t think everyone who says he is a victim automatically qualifies i don\\u2019t think a homely disfigured bald minority person with a room temperature iq who limps and stutters is necessarily always a victim although i will say that she probably shouldn\\u2019t be out trying to get work as a receptionist but maybe that\\u2019s just the way it oughtta bei\\u2019m more interested in the real victims people who have been fucked over by the system because the united states is a christian racist nation with a rigged economic system run for three hundred years by the least morally qualified of the two sexes there were bound to be some real victims people who have been elaborately fucked overthe way i see it this country has only four real victim groups indians blacks women and gays i purposely left out the spanish and asians because when you look at what happened to the indians and the blacks the spanish and asian people had a walk in the park it\\u2019s not even close not to downplay the shit they\\u2019ve had to eat but in about one hundred years the spanish and asians are going to be running this country so they\\u2019ll have plenty of chances to get even with the gray peoplelet\\u2019s get to some of these other nonvictims you probably noticed elsewhere i used the word fat i used that word because that\\u2019s what fat people are they\\u2019re fat they\\u2019re not large they\\u2019re not stout chunky hefty or plump and they\\u2019re not bigboned dinosaurs are bigboned these people are not necessarily obese either obese is a medical term and they\\u2019re not overweight overweight implies there is some correct weight there is no correct weight heavy is also a misleading term an aircraft carrier is heavy it is not fat only people are fat that\\u2019s what fat people are they\\u2019re fat i offer no apology for this it is not intended as criticism or insult it is simply descriptive language i don\\u2019t like euphemisms euphemisms are a form of lying fat people are not gravitationally disadvantaged they\\u2019re fat i prefer seeing things the way they are not the way some people wish they werei don\\u2019t believe groups deserve extraspecial names for instance midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they are not little people infants are little people leprechauns are little people  midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they don\\u2019t get any taller by calling them little people i wish their lives were different i wish they didn\\u2019t have to go around starring at other peoples crotches but i can\\u2019t fix that and i\\u2019m not going to lie about what they are the politically sensitive commandos would probably like me to call them \\u201cvertically challenged\\u201d they are not vertically challenged a skydiver is vertically challenged the person who designed the empire state building was vertically challenged midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfsalso crippled people are crippled they are not differentlyabled if you insist on using such tortured language as differentlyabled then you must use it on all of us we\\u2019re all differentlyabled you can do things i can\\u2019t do i can do things you can\\u2019t do i can pick my nose with my thumb i can switch hands while masturbating and gain a stroke we are all differentlyabled crippled people are crippled it\\u2019s a perfectly honorable word there is no shame in it it\\u2019s in the bible \\u201cjesus healed the cripples\\u201d he didn\\u2019t \\u201cengage in rehabilitative strategies for the physically disadvantaged\\u201dso leaving women and gays aside for a moment i\\u2019ve narrowed it down to blacks and indians let\\u2019s talk about what we ought to call them and remember this has nothing to do with the people themselves it has to do with the wordsand by the way when it comes to liberal language vandals i must agree with there underlying premise white europeans and their descendants are morally unattractive people who are responsible for most of the world\\u2019s suffering that part is easy you would have to be uh visually impaired not to see it the impulse behind political correctness is a good one but like every good impulse in america it has to be grotesquely distorted beyond usefulnessclearly these are victims but i don\\u2019t agree that these failed campus revolutionaries know what to do about them when they\\u2019re not busy curtailing freedom of speech they\\u2019re running around inventing absurd hyphenated names designed to make people feel better remember these are the white elitists in there customary paternalistic role protecting helpless inept minority victims  big daddy white boss always knows bestso let me tell you how i handle some of these speech issues first of all i say \\u201cblack\\u201d i say \\u201cblack\\u201d because most black people prefer \\u201cblack\\u201d i don\\u2019t say \\u201cpeople of color\\u201d people of color sounds like something you see when you are on mushrooms besides the use of people of color is dishonest it means precisely the same thing as colored people if you\\u2019re not willing to say \\u201ccolored people\\u201d you shouldn\\u2019t be saying \\u201cpeople of color\\u201dbesides the whole idea of color is bullshit anyway what should we call white people \\u201cpeople of no color\\u201d isn\\u2019t pink a color in fact white people aren\\u2019t really white at all they\\u2019re different shades of pink olive and beige in other words they\\u2019re colored and black people are rarely black i see mostly different shades of brown and tan in fact some lightskinned black people are lighter than the darkest white people look how dark the people in india are they\\u2019re dark brown but they\\u2019re still considered white people what\\u2019s going on here may i see the color chart \\u201cpeople of color\\u201d is an awkward bullshit  liberalguilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it shall we call fat people \\u201cpeople of size\\u201dby the way i think the whole reason we are encouraged in this country to think of ourselves as black and white instead of pink and brown which is what we are is that black and white are complete opposites that cannot be reconciled black and white can never come together pink and brown on the other hand might just stand a chance of being blended might just come together can\\u2019t have that doesn\\u2019t fit the plani also don\\u2019t say \\u201cafricanamerican\\u201d i find it completely confusing which part of africa are we talking about what about egypt egypt is in africa egyptians aren\\u2019t black they\\u2019re like the people in india they\\u2019re the dark brown white people but they\\u2019re africans so why wouldn\\u2019t an egyptian who becomes a us citizen be an africanamericanthe same thing goes for the republic of south africa suppose a white racist from south africa becomes an american citizen well first of all he\\u2019d find plenty of company but couldn\\u2019t he also be called an african american it seems to me that a racist white southafrican guy could come here and call himself africanamerican just to piss off black people and by the way what about a black person born in south africa who moves here and becomes a citizen what is he is he a africansouthafricanamerican or a southafricanafricanamerican all right back to the hemisphere how about a black women who is a citizen of jamaica according to pc doctrine she\\u2019s africanjamaican right but if she becomes a us citizen she\\u2019s a jamaicanamerican and yet if one of these language crusaders saw her on the street he\\u2019d think she was africanamerican unless he knew her personally in which case he\\u2019d have to decide between africanjamaicanamerican and jamaicanafricanamerican ya know it\\u2019s just so much liberal bullshit labels divide people we need fewer labels not morei am an army brat  that is someone who doesn\\u2019t really belong anywhere anymore but has to fake it their entire life that they do  but now i find that i am in the vanguard of the culture  so many americans have the same experience of being displaced and not belonging anywhere because of the widespread moving away from one\\u2019s roots that it has become normal  so to feel we have roots we turn to things like pop music which is now commercialized  so our roots are not roots at all but we are just consumers being manipulated by our own narcissismyour email address will not be published required fields are marked nameemailwebsite \\n\\ndavid cross worst daddy in

forever have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife huh who her oh hell yeah well it\\u2019s one of life\\u2019s little moments isn\\u2019t it it\\u2019s one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time you can\\u2019t postpone that you can\\u2019t put that off and be walking around like this you\\u2019ve got to get in there and clear that thing out you\\u2019ve got to rescue your underwear there\\u2019s a letter in your mailbox that\\u2019s right and you have to rectify that situation so that you can move along to your next embarrassing moment which is probably scheduled immediately that\\u2019s the way life is full of those little moments everybody knows them everybody recognizes them you ever been at a really loud party i mean a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly and in order to be heard even by the person standing right next to you you\\u2019ve got to be screaming at the top of your lungs but every now and then at a party it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time and only your voice can be heard right i know i know well what i\\u2019m going to do i\\u2019m going to have my testicles laminated life\\u2019s little moments you ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt and you have to just kind of keep talking you know and make believe it\\u2019s part of the design works all right if you\\u2019re wearing a hawaiian shirt but otherwise they\\u2019re going to notice ed you got a big snot on your shirt some guys are really cruel you know and some of these things are not even your fault these little things that happen you didn\\u2019t cause the situation a lot of time you\\u2019re the victim you walk into some situation and suddenly you\\u2019re the one who\\u2019s taking all the heat not your fault give you an example of the kind of thing i mean did you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guy\\u2019s hand and you suddenly realize he doesn\\u2019t have a complete hand and you got to make believe it feels great right you can\\u2019t go ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhhh you can\\u2019t do that it\\u2019s not even an option you got to hang in there and say hi hey swell hand give me three hi  yo not your fault you didn\\u2019t cause that you weren\\u2019t even there when it happened to the guyyou were probably out walking your dog which is what i\\u2019m usually doing walking my dog because i love my dog i love all my dogs i love every dog i ever had i remember them all and i love every one of them still love all my dogs and i\\u2019ve had me a lot of god damn dogs in my lifetime i have had me a bunch of different dogs because you do keep getting a new dog don\\u2019t you you just keep getting one dog after another that\\u2019s the whole secret of life life is a series of dogs it\\u2019s true you just keep getting a new dog don\\u2019t you that\\u2019s what\\u2019s good about them they don\\u2019t live too long and you can go get a new god damn dog sometimes you can get a dog looks exactly like the dog you used to have right you shop around a little bit you can find a dog identical to your former dog and that\\u2019s real handy because you don\\u2019t have to change the pictures on your mirror or anything right you just bring the dead one into the pet shop throw him up on the counter say give me another one of them that was real good and they\\u2019ll give you a carbon copy of your exgod damn dog now my favorite dog that i ever had in my whole lifetime was tippie tippie was a good dog some of you remember i\\u2019ve talked about tippie tippie was a good dog tippie was a mixed terrier you know that word mixed that the veterinarian puts on the form when even he don\\u2019t know what the fuck you got you bring in a little mixed puppy to a veterinarian and say what is it he\\u2019ll say well it\\u2019s definitely not a monkey tippie was actually part dodge dart poor tippie was full of guilt so much so in fact she\\u2019s the only dog i ever had who committed suicide yeah well we don\\u2019t say it like that around the house we say she put herself to sleep but she ran out in front of a milk truck that\\u2019s fucking suicide but that was her decision that\\u2019s what tippie wanted to do and that\\u2019s the way it is in our family if you want to commit suicide we back you up so we supported tippie in her little suicide decision then we brought her into the pet shop threw her up on the counter and said give us something bigger we\\u2019re trading up we was looking for a bigger god damn dog because tippie had been teenie even before the truck came by the truck had made her teenier wider but teenier and we was looking for a bigger god damn dog not too big you know i don\\u2019t like a dog who\\u2019s bigger than i am it\\u2019s bad enough looking for shit in one direction without having to duck flying turds as well a good rule of thumb is keep the dog\\u2019s asshole below eye level so we compromised and we got us a midsized dog knee high just about like this size here best size you can own by the way most people know this is the ideal size dog to have you know why anybody comes to visit you the first thing that dog does is take his nose and put it right in their crotch oohh oohh he smells my dog no marge i don\\u2019t believe that\\u2019s the animal he has in mind and people get embarrassed by that especially the owner of the dog the owner\\u2019s the one who\\u2019s saying stop that stop that will you stop that now stop it i\\u2019m awfully sorry about this not me i say get in there and get some of that get in there and sniff that thing out go on listen would you mind spreading your legs a little bit so he can get right in there yeah stand like this for a little while would you okay looking good now so how\\u2019s your mom and dad doing anyway well god bless them it\\u2019s a wonderful couple go around the back check it out in the back sniff that other thing in the back there

real nice of you to come and call on us like this every one of us is always glad to see you around here especially that god damn dog those dogs are great they\\u2019ll break the ice when a new neighbor comes to call hi we\\u2019re the johnsons what\\u2019s his name ball sniffer he\\u2019s a crotch hound let me know if you want to get circumcised he\\u2019s on duty till  o\\u2019clock dogs are a constant source of entertainment did you ever have a dog that ate cat turds some of them do some of you must know that did you ever have a dog eat cat turds yeah of course you got to have a cat you know you can\\u2019t be buying cat turds at the supermarket but it\\u2019s true some dogs will eat cat turds yeah don\\u2019t let them lick you that day get a bottle of listerine for him try to make him gargle pour it down his throat and tell him to howl come on howl howl god damn it stomp on his tail howl i said god damn it howl oh dogs are a lot of fun did you ever have a dog that ate a bunch of colored balloons and then he takes a shit and it\\u2019s real decorative like or sometimes at christmas they\\u2019ll eat some tinsel and take a shiny shit wow look mom can we hang it on the tree well it is considered good luck in some cultures here\\u2019s a little household hint for you this will help you clean up after your dogs feed your dog a lot of rubber bands put a lot of rubber bands in with his regular food then when he takes a shit there\\u2019s usually a little loop in the end of it you just pick it up by the loop do you know what i mean throw it in the neighbor\\u2019s yard yeah that\\u2019s why i travel around give these little household hints bet you never read that one in heloise huhyeah about time for me to get a little drink of water figure this stuff is safe to drink huh actually i don\\u2019t care if it\\u2019s safe or not i drink it anyway you know why because i\\u2019m an american and i expect a little cancer in my food and water that\\u2019s right i\\u2019m a loyal american and i\\u2019m not happy unless i\\u2019ve let government and industry poison me a little bit every day let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here ah a little cancer never hurt anybody everybody needs a little cancer i think it\\u2019s good for you keeps you on your toes besides i ain\\u2019t afraid of cancer i had broccoli for lunch broccoli kills cancer a lot of people don\\u2019t know that it\\u2019s not out yet it\\u2019s true you find out you got some cancer get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli that\\u2019ll wipe it right out in a day or two cauliflower too cauliflower kills the really big cancers the ones you can see through clothing from across the street broccoli kills the little ones the ones that are slowly eating you away from inside while your god damn goofy halfeducated doctor keeps telling you you\\u2019re doing fine jim in fact bring your doctor a bowel of broccoli he\\u2019s probably got cancer too probably picked it up from you they don\\u2019t know what they\\u2019re doing it\\u2019s all guesswork in a white coat here let me have a few more sips of industrial waste ah maybe maybe i can turn them cancers against one another that\\u2019s what you got to hope for you know that you get more than one cancer so they eat each other up instead of you in fact the way i look at it the most cancer you got the healthier you are well i know some people don\\u2019t like you to talk about those things i know that some people don\\u2019t like you to mention certain things some people don\\u2019t want you to say this some people don\\u2019t want you to say that some people think if you mention some things they might happensome people are really fucking stupid did you ever notice that how many really stupid people you run into during the day god damn there\\u2019s a lot of stupid bastards walking around carry a little pad and pencil with you you wind up with  or  names by the end of the day look at it this way think of how stupid the average person is and then realize half of them are stupider than that and it doesn\\u2019t take you very long to spot one of them does it take you about eight seconds you\\u2019ll be listening to some guy and say this guy is fucking stupid then then there are some people they\\u2019re not stupid they\\u2019re full of shit huh that doesn\\u2019t take very long to spot either does it take you about the same amount of time you\\u2019ll be listening to some guy saying well he\\u2019s fairly intelligent ah he\\u2019s full of shit then there are some people they\\u2019re not stupid they\\u2019re not full of shit they\\u2019re fucking nuts dan quayle is all three all three stupid full of shit and fucking nuts and where did he get that wife of his have you taken a good look at that marilyn quayle where did he get her at a halloween party or something she looks like prince charles for christ\\u2019s sake let me ask you something does he actually have to fuck that woman huh god help him i wouldn\\u2019t fuck her with a stolen dickthat\\u2019s my political humor people like it when you\\u2019re topical oh some people don\\u2019t like you to talk like that oh some people would like to shut you up for saying those things you know that lots of people lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk tell you what you can\\u2019t talk about sometimes they\\u2019ll say well you can talk about something but you can\\u2019t joke about it say you can\\u2019t joke about it because it\\u2019s not funny comedians run into that shit all the time like rape they\\u2019ll say you can\\u2019t joke about rape rape\\u2019s not funny i say fuck you i think it\\u2019s hilarious how do you like that i can prove to you that rape is funny picture porky pig raping elmer fudd see hey why do you think they call him porky huh i know what you\\u2019re going to say elmer was asking for it elmer was coming on to porky porky couldn\\u2019t help himself he got a hardon he got horny he lost control he went out of his mind lot of men talk like that lot of men think that way they think it\\u2019s the woman\\u2019s fault they like to blame the rape on the woman say hey she had it coming she was wearing a short skirt these guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers don\\u2019t seem fair to me don\\u2019t seem right but you can joke about it i believe you can joke about anything it all depends on how you construct the joke what the exaggeration is what the exaggeration is because every joke needs one exaggeration every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion give you an example did you ever see a news story like this is the paper every now and then you run into a story that says some guy broke into a house stole a lot of things and while he was in there he raped an  old woman and i\\u2019m thinking to myself why what the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have i want to say why did you do that well she was coming on to me we were dancing and i got horny hey she was asking for it she had on a tight bathrobe i say jesus christ be a little fucking selective next time will you now speaking of rape you know what i wonder i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole these are the kind of things i think about when i\\u2019m sitting home alone and the power goes out i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole i mean per capita i know the populations are different most people think it\\u2019s the equator i think it\\u2019s the north pole people think it\\u2019s the equator because it\\u2019s hot down there they don\\u2019t wear a lot of clothing guys can see women\\u2019s tits they get horny and there\\u2019s a lot of fucking going on that\\u2019s exactly why there\\u2019s less rape at the equator because there\\u2019s a lot of fucking going on you can tell there\\u2019s a lot of fucking at the equator take a look at the population figures billions of people life near the equator how many eskimos we got   no one\\u2019s getting laid at the north pole it\\u2019s too fucking cold guys say to their wives hey tonight honey huh tonight huh are you crazy the wind chill factor is  below these guys are deprived they\\u2019re horny they\\u2019re pent up every now and then they bust out they got to rape somebody now the biggest problem an eskimo rapist has trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman who\\u2019s kicking did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesn\\u2019t want to take them off you would lose your hard on in the process up at the north pole your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes that\\u2019s another thing i wonder i wonder does a rapist have a hard on when he leaves the house in the morning or does he develop it during the day when he\\u2019s walking around looking for somebody these are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schoolsnow i probably got the feminists all pissed off at me because i\\u2019m joking about rape feminists want to control your language feminists want to tell you how to talk and they\\u2019re not alone they\\u2019re not alone i\\u2019m not picking on the feminists they got a lot of company in this country there\\u2019s a lot of groups lot of institutions in this country want to control your language tell you what you can say and what you can\\u2019t say government wants to tell you some things you can\\u2019t say because they\\u2019re against the law or you can\\u2019t say this because it\\u2019s against a regulation or here\\u2019s something you can\\u2019t say because it\\u2019s a secret you can\\u2019t tell him that because he\\u2019s not cleared to know that government wants to control information and control language because that\\u2019s the way you control thought and basically that\\u2019s the game they\\u2019re insame with religion religion is nothing but mind control religion is just trying to control your mind control your thoughts so they\\u2019re going to tell you some things you shouldn\\u2019t say because they\\u2019re sins and besides telling you things you shouldn\\u2019t say religion\\u2019s going to suggest to you some things you ought to be saying here\\u2019s something you ought to say first thing when you wake up in the morning here\\u2019s something you ought to say just before you go to sleep at night here\\u2019s something we always say on the third wednesday in april after the first full moon in spring at  when the bells ring religion is always suggesting things you ought to be saying same with political groups of all kinds political activists antibiased groups special interest groups are going to suggest the correct political vocabulary the way you ought to be saying things and that\\u2019s where the feminists come innow as i said i got nothing against the feminists in fact i happen to agree with most of the feminist philosophy i have read i agree for instance that for the most part men are vain ignorant greedy brutal assholes who\\u2019ve just about ruined this planet\\u2026 who\\u2019ve just about ruined this planet because they\\u2019re afraid someone might have a bigger dick out there somewhere men are basically insecure about the size of their dicks and so they go to war over it you don\\u2019t have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work it goes something like this what they have bigger dicks bomb them and of course the bombs and the bullets and the rockets are all shaped like dicks i don\\u2019t understand that part of it but it is part of the equation so i agree with that abstract that man men males have pushed the technology that just about has this planet in a stranglehold mother earth raped again guess who eh she was asking for it i also happen to like it when feminists attack these fat ass housewives who think there\\u2019s nothing more to life than sitting home on the telephone drinking coffee watching tv and pumping out a baby every nine months ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom will seven be enough bob ba boom ba boom but what\\u2019s the alternative what\\u2019s the alternative to pumping out a unit every nine months pointless careerism putting on a man tailored suit with shoulder pads and imitating all the worst behavior of men this is the noblest thing that women can think of to take a job in a criminal corporation that\\u2019s poisoning the environment and robbing customers out of their money this is the worthiest thing they can think of isn\\u2019t there something nobler they can do to be helping this planet heal you don\\u2019t hear much about that from these middle class women i\\u2019ve noticed that most of these feminists are white middle class women they don\\u2019t give a shit about black women\\u2019s problems they don\\u2019t care about latino women all they\\u2019re interested in is their own reproductive freedom and their pocketbooks but when it comes to changing the language i think they make some good points because we do think in language and so the quality of our thoughts and ideas could only be as good as the quality of our language so maybe some of this patriarchal shit ought to go away i think spokesmen ought to be spokesperson i think chairman ought to be chairperson i think mankind ought to be humankind but they take it too far they take themselves too seriously the exaggerate they want me to call that thing in the street a person hole cover i think that\\u2019s taking it a little bit too far what would you call a lady\\u2019s man a person\\u2019s person that would make a heman an it person little kids would be afraid of the boogie person they\\u2019d look up in the sky and see the person in the moon guys would say come back here and fight like a person and we\\u2019d all sing for it\\u2019s a jolly good person that\\u2019s the kind of thing you would hear on late night with david letterperson you know what i mean so i think it\\u2019s an exaggeration and i like to piss off any group that takes itself a little bit too seriously and it does not take a lot of imagination to piss off a feminist all you got to do is run into now headquarters or ms magazine and say hey which one of you cute little cupcakes wants to come home and cook me a nice meal and give me a blow job blow job oh that pisses them off you want to piss off a feminist call her a cum catcher that\\u2019ll get her attention ah don\\u2019t act disgusted don\\u2019t act disgusted half of you are going to go home and go down on each other tonight remember if you\\u2019re willing to swallow cum let\\u2019s not make believe something i said was disgusting okay all right let\\u2019s not have a double standard here one standard will do just finenow speaking of blowjobs do you know why they call it a blowjob so it\\u2019ll sound like it has kind of a work ethic attached to it make you feel like you did something useful for the economy long as i\\u2019m being a complete pig up here let me ask you guys a question let me ask one question of the men are you ever able to watch a woman eating a banana and not think about a blowjob huh i can\\u2019t do it i can\\u2019t do it and i know why i\\u2019m a sick evil fuck i know that i accept that but i can\\u2019t do it eating a banana eating a pickle licking on an ice cream cone i\\u2019m saying to myself look at the tongue on her wow so you women be careful when you\\u2019re standing out in front of that hagen daas because god damn it we\\u2019re watching and god damn it we\\u2019re thinking another woman\\u2019s issue prostitution i do not understand why prostitution is illegal why should prostitution be illegal selling is legal fucking is legal why isn\\u2019t selling fucking legal you know why should it be illegal to sell something that\\u2019s perfectly legal to give away i can\\u2019t follow the logic on that at all of all the things you can do too a person giving someone an orgasm is hardly the worst thing in the world in the army they give you a medal for spraying napalm on people civilian life you go to jail for giving someone an orgasm maybe i\\u2019m not supposed to understand iti got strange ideas anyway you know what i think they ought to do with that miss american contest i think they ought to make the losers keep coming back until they win i\\u2019ll tell you that would get a little spooky after about  years or so huh i just want to work on world peace fine sit down before you fall down will you and pick up all these goddamn batons i got a lot of ideas you know what i think i think kleenex ought to have little targets on them wouldn\\u2019t that be a good idea little bulls eyes right in the middle of the kleenex make it kind of sporting when you\\u2019re with your friends blowing nose sound look dave an  that\\u2019s a good idea i got a lot of good ideas trouble is most of them suck i got a lot of

i\\u2019m brain dead here you people got no respect for the brain dead hey you got to be brain dead to watch geraldo in the first place you might as well watch him when you\\u2019re clinically brain dead there\\u2019s one other thing i thought about concerning this comatose thing and this might help you someday this little piece of information might come in handy sometime in the future if you\\u2019re in this circumstance if you knew a family if you knew a family and one of them was a homosexual and he was in an automobile accident and he was comatose you could always comfort that family by saying well look at it this way he was a fruit now he\\u2019s a vegetable listen at least he\\u2019s still in the produce sectionnow i probably got some other group pissed off at me because i said fruit there\\u2019s a different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything you\\u2019re not supposed to say can\\u2019t say fruit can\\u2019t say faggot can\\u2019t say queer can\\u2019t say nancy boy can\\u2019t say pansy can\\u2019t say ngger boogie jig jiggaboo skinhead jungle bunny moolie moolie yan or schwarz can\\u2019t say yid heeb zeeb kike mackie dego ginny wop ginzo greaser greaseball spick beaner oya tiger pr mick donkey turkey limey frog squarehead kraut jerry hun chink jap nip slope slopehead zip zipper head gook there is absolutely nothing wrong\\u2026 there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves they\\u2019re only words it\\u2019s the context that counts it\\u2019s the user it\\u2019s the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad the words are completely neutral the words are innocent i get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language bullshit it\\u2019s the context that makes them good or bad the context that makes them good or bad for instance you take the word ngger there is absolutely nothing wrong with the word ngger in and of itself it\\u2019s the racist asshole that\\u2019s using it that you ought to be concerned about we don\\u2019t care when richard pryor or eddie murphy says it why because we know they\\u2019re not racists they\\u2019re nggers context context we don\\u2019t mind their context because we know they\\u2019re black hey i know i\\u2019m whitey the blueeyed devil patio fake gray boy honkie motherfucker myself don\\u2019t bother my ass they\\u2019re only words you can\\u2019t be afraid of words that speak the truth even if it\\u2019s an unpleasant truth like the fact that there\\u2019s a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country i don\\u2019t like words that hide the truth i don\\u2019t like words that conceal reality i don\\u2019t like euphemisms or euphemistic language and american english is loaded with euphemisms because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality americans have trouble facing the truth so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it and it gets worse with every generation for some reason it just keeps getting worsei\\u2019ll give you an example of that there\\u2019s a condition in combat most people know about it it\\u2019s when a fighting person\\u2019s nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum can\\u2019t take any more input the nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap in the first world war that condition was called shell shock simple honest direct language two syllables shell shock almost sounds like the guns themselves that was  years ago then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue four syllables now it takes a little longer to say doesn\\u2019t seem to hurt as much fatigue is a nicer word than shock shell shock battle fatigue then we had the war in korea in  madison avenue was riding high by that time and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion hey we\\u2019re up to eight syllables now and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase it\\u2019s totally sterile now operational exhaustion sounds like something that might happen to your car then of course came the war in viet nam which has only been over for about  or  years and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war i guess it\\u2019s no surprise that the very same condition was called posttraumatic stress disorder still eight syllables but we\\u2019ve added a hyphen and the pain is completely buried under jargon posttraumatic stress disorder i bet you if we\\u2019d have still been calling it shell shock some of them viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time but it didn\\u2019t happen and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language that language that takes the life out of lifeand it is a function of time it does keep getting worse give you another example sometime during my life sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue i wasn\\u2019t notified of this no one asked me if i agreed with it it just happened\\ntoilet paper became bathroom tissue\\n sneakers became running shoes\\n false teeth became dental appliances\\n medicine became medication\\n information became directory assistance\\n the dump became the landfill\\n car crashes became automobile accidents\\n partly cloudy became partly sunny\\n motels became motor lodges\\n house trailers became mobile homes\\n used cars became previously owned transportation\\n room service became guest room dining\\n and constipation became occasional irregularity\\n when i was a little kid if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional\\n poor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities\\n and they\\u2019re broke they\\u2019re broke they don\\u2019t have a negative cash flow position they\\u2019re fucking broke\\n because a lot of them were fired you know fired management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce\\n smug greedy wellfed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins it\\u2019s as simple as that\\n the cia doesn\\u2019t kill anybody any more they neutralize people or they depopulate the area\\n the government doesn\\u2019t lie it engages in disinformation\\n the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call sunshine units\\n israeli murderers are called commandos\\n arab commandos are called terrorists\\n contra killers are called freedom fighters well if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part of it to us do they never mention that part of it\\nsome of this stuff is just silly we all know that like on the airlines they say they want to pre board well what the hell is pre board what does that mean to get on before you get on\\nthey say they\\u2019re going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance cripples simple honest direct language there\\u2019s no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary no shame attached to it in fact it\\u2019s a word used in bible translations jesus healed the cripples doesn\\u2019t take seven words to describe that condition but we don\\u2019t have any cripples in this country any more we have the physically challenged is that a grotesque enough evasion for you\\nhow about differently abled i\\u2019ve heard them called that differently abled you can\\u2019t even call these people handicapped anymore they\\u2019ll say we\\u2019re not handicapped we\\u2019re handy capable these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition somehow you\\u2019ll change the condition well hey cousin doesn\\u2019t happen doesn\\u2019t happen\\nwe have no more deaf people in this country hearing impaired\\n no one\\u2019s blind any more partially sighted or visually impaired\\n we have no more stupid people everybody has a learning disorder or he\\u2019s minimally exceptional how would you like to be told that about your child he\\u2019s minimally exceptional oh thank god for that\\n psychologists actually have started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficits\\nit\\u2019s getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient\\n and we have no more old people in this country no more old people we shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens isn\\u2019t that a typically american  century phrase bloodless lifeless no pulse in one of them a senior citizen and i\\u2019ve accepted that one i\\u2019ve come to terms with it i know it\\u2019s here to stay we\\u2019ll never get rid of it that\\u2019s what they\\u2019re going to be called so i\\u2019ll relax on that but the one i do resist the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they say look at him dan he\\u2019s  years young imagine the fear of aging that reveals to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone to have to use an antonym and fear of aging is natural it\\u2019s universal isn\\u2019t it we all have that no one wants to get old no one wants to die but we do so we bullshit ourselves i started bullshitting myself when i got to my \\u2019s soon as i was in my \\u2019s i\\u2019d look in the mirror and i\\u2019d say well i guess i\\u2019m getting older older sounds a little better than old doesn\\u2019t it sounds like it might even last a little longer bullshit i\\u2019m getting old and it\\u2019s okay because thanks to our fear of death in this country i won\\u2019t have to die i\\u2019ll pass away or i\\u2019ll expire like a magazine subscription if it happens in the hospital they\\u2019ll call it a terminal episode the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome and if it\\u2019s the result of malpractice they\\u2019ll say it was a therapeutic misadventure i\\u2019m telling you some of this language makes me want to vomit well maybe not vomit makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein

              "' sometimes listed as on location george carlin at phoenixperformed at the celebrity star theater in phoenix on july   this is george carlin and i thought we might take a look at some of the pictures from the days when my show business career was just starting this is one of the earliest photos of my days as an actor here i’m playing the part of a baby in an early production of a play called “hold onto the rail” as proof of the intensity i brought to the role lying nearby you can see a doll that i had recently strangled this is a candid photo of my first manager and i having a business conference in the park where we knew we couldn’t be bugged in this photo i am trying out a new funny face that i had been working on for about six months now here i am with uh two of my fellow actors from the west harlem production of either ben hur or the sound of music you can’t really tell from what we’re wearing there because those are our street clothes and the person off to one side is our personal manager who insisted on being in all of our publicity photos this is a rare photo uh this is a photo of me in a singing group called the mills brothers uh we didn’t know that there was already a group in existence by that name the mills brothers sued us so we dropped two guys and changed the named to mickey and sylvia this is a picture of the time i came in second in a suntan contest the boy in the middle won but it was uh later he was disqualified when it was discovered he had been using pep pills uh this is the same photo with the negative reversed as you can see the suntans are approximately the same on the back this is me during an early suicide attempt i was despondent at that time because my puberty was coming along very slowly this one was taken during the nationwide search for a replacement for lassie i remember this picture i’m trying to get my dog spotty a fox terrier to stand up straight and act like a collie uh although he didn’t get the part later he did go on to become mars the cat god rest his soul’s manager this is a picture of me and the boy who doubled for me during my early film career normally i did all my own stunts except for the scenes involving homosexuality of course and this boy served that purpose this is me singing in a trio i had started which was called the inkspots oddly enough the naacp sued the trio and forced me to drop out when i couldn’t prove there was such a thing as flesh colored ink this is my first communion picture it was so well received that i decided to use it for publicity and to this day this is the picture that i send out when producers call and ask me if i’m interested in serious actingand that brings me to today here in phoenix arizona where we’re going to shoot one of these comedy shows for the first time in the round so i’ll see you around all right now i’m starting to feel it marty let’s go marty all right no i want to do like this is what guys who run do sprinters do this  dash i

dime  in the morning black tshirts empty the wishing well it’s our money and i want some of it back i wonder if movie directors have credits on their dreams and i wonder why there’s no blue food where the hell is the blue food every other food is represented… i mean every other color every other color is represented i mean every color… okay red is raspberry cherry and strawberry orange is orange yellow is lemon green is lime brown is meat there’s no blue food why the hell was blue left out of the food thing somebody’s got the blue food goddammit somebody’s got it it probably bestows immortality that’s why we haven’t been given any and don’t say blueberries we know they’re purple you look at a blueberry and you see that sucker is purple bleu cheese no bleu cheese is just white cheese with a bunch of mold in it man and bluefish god knows you open one up they’re every color under the sun well enough of that shit i wonder i wonder which came first skilled workers or unskilled and who decided i figure originally all we had was workers and then they decided this is hard and they called themselves skilled and someone else came along they couldn’t do it poor unskilled son of a bitch they moved right past his ass man when he was just in the landing area do you think maybe charlie mccarthy has little wooden balls i’ve always wondered that hi charlie hi charlie you know what i wonder about i wonder we buy flowers why do we buy flowers they’re free they grow all over yet we buy them we pay good money for flowers flowers that are dying i might add that’s a little strange flowers is one flowers is one of the few things that you buy you bring it to your house and if they die you don’t give a shit normally you’d be asking for your money back on anything that died are you kidding me these things keeled over on the piano flowers i wonder why i’ve never seen anyone cleaning a church have you i’ve never seen someone cleaning a church a lot of things go on in church you never see a cleaning crew going in there with pails and mops and shit it just never happens why don’t they clean churches you know why churches don’t need to be cleaned they clean themselves overnight that’s how they know they’re churches come back the next morning shit it’s still clean must be a churchdoes the time bother you i get bothered by the time not so much the time itself the people bother me for the time people come up to me on the street i’m sure you’ve had this happen to you people come up to you and say what time it is or they might say what time is it i shouldn’t get into these ballads you’ve had people come up to you and say what time is it what time is it as if you personally were responsible for keeping time you know i feel i feel honored first of all that they thought i was the man in charge but i do have to explain you don’t see official timekeeper on here do you i don’t have the time of course not do you have the time that’s another way they say it do you have the time i say uh no i don’t believe i do i certainly didn’t have it this morning did you leave it somewhere well do you have the time no i don’t have the time i use a little of it like everyone you know but i don’t have it i think i think the navy has it in washington isn’t that they keep it in an observatory that’s right sure they let out a little of it each day not too much they wouldn’t want to give us too much just enough time sometimes they’ll say do you know what time it is and i say yes i hate to disappoint them but there is no time there is no time i don’t mean there’s no time i mean there’s no time when the hell is it we made that whole thing up there’s no time we made it up it’s a manmade invention time there are no numbers up in the sky i’ve looked they’re not there we made this stuff up when is it when the hell is it when are we i ask you when are we sometimes we think we know where we are but we don’t really know when we are when the hell is it all the time zones are different every calendar you run across is different they’ll all give you a different answer these are calendars these are made to… to keep track of time everybody’s got a different one the chinese are way up there in the  and ’s hebrew calendar is way up in the  and ’s we’re up at about  well shit this ain’t a couple of weeks these people are off this is thousands of goddamn years that are missing man how did they do that we don’t we don’t know when the hell is it it could be the middle of last month for all we know i mean time is so we’ve got it down so perfect that every four years we have to stick in an extra day just to make sure it still works and we call it february  bullshit it’s march  and i know it it just feels like march  you can’t keep track of the time what’s the sense give you an example there’s a moment coming it’s not here yet it’s still on the way it’s in the future it hasn’t arrived here it comes here it is oh shit it’s gone there’s no now there’s no now everything is the near future or the recent past but there’s no present welcome to the present whoosh gone again it’s just so imprecise we don’t even care to use the minutes and seconds and hours that we’ve been given everybody’s very vague about the time they say what time you got i got uh i got just after just after geez i must be slow i had going on and where did that imprecision begin why is it we’re not so sure i know one of the clues that happened to me was when they started telling me about moments when i was a kid they were trying to teach me how to tell time and of course you can’t tell time time tells you but they were trying they were trying to show me now the big hand i said i don’t have a big hand never mind look at the clock and the clock is so wonderful there’s so much emotion attached to a clock face i hate digital clocks digital clocks rob me of all the emotional experience of the spatial relationships on that face of the clock isn’t it true i mean don’t you always feel that this half hour when it comes down from  down to  goes by a lot quicker than this half hour when it has to come up fighting gravity all the way i know it does go a lot quicker yeah oh i got ya yeah i’ll tell ya i’ll tell ya this if i only have a half to live i want it to be this one man i wanna last just a little bit longer than this one here it’s vague that’s all i’m saying it’s very vague how we treat time we have all these wonderful expressions we say now now is an interesting one when now you want that now yes well would you like to try again or sometimes just now just now did you hear that what just now you must mean just then don’t you yes just then but there it goes again when – now – no not now pardon me do you have the time when do you mean now or when you asked me this shit is moving ruth we got a lot of these vague terms right away immediately at once lickety split just like that nothing flat drop of a hat no time at all as quick as you can say jack robinson i’m sure you’ve done that to people i’ll be back before you can say jack robinson jack robinson you’re not back how about a jiffy a jiffy or a flash which is quicker a jiffy or a flash i think there are two flashes in a jiffy myself but god knows how many jiffies there are in two shakes of a lamb’s tail and why did they use two shakes of a lamb’s tail what’s wrong with the basic unit of measurement one shake of a lamb’s tail we can do our own arithmetic thank you belched a little there tried to swallow that one then we have words like soon soon that’s a very emotional word there’s a lot of potential for drama in that word soon soon soon is your mother coming home uhhuh when soon real soon as soon as she can sooner than you think that’s kind of a spooky one sooner than i think that’s a little bit like before you know it i’ll be back before you know it he did it holy christ look at that and we go on with these terms that we use these vague terms of time one of these days before long any time now well that’s true everything is gonna happen any time now any day now that’s kind of a snotty one any day now hey i’ll be giving you that five bucks i owe you bill yeah any day now sooner or later now and then once in a while from time to time in a little while in a little while that will just be a little while that’s a wonderful one and i just love that it sounds so benign just a little while couldn’t hurt you could it you can wait a little while it’ll only be a little while longer just a little while that’s so different from a short time short time sounds sound almost terminal doesn’t it you only have a short time whereas you have a little while oh i’d rather have a little while than a short time you know we’ve got long ways we measure time we’ve got vast distances of time we measure people will say things like kingdom come i’m… i’m gonna be standing here till kingdom come shit i don’t have that on my watch doomsday you say doomsday till the cows come home now that’s an easy one to understand that’s long about dusk isn’t it if you leave them out overnight they’d burst here’s a long period of time forever some people will tell you gosh i’ve been standing on this line forever look at this dave this man has been standing on line forever he looks fairly fresh to me almost like an eternity people will tell you it’s… it’s almost like an eternity as if they had experience with eternities now you must have a favorite period of time i have some favorites i just want to try a few of them on you it isn’t easy uh to select a favorite period of time so many of them are attractive but there are little periods of time that um that you might relate to of course the most basic period of time i feel is five minutes that seems to be the one everyone chooses if they need to think of a period of time real quickly they just go five minutes just five minutes i’ll be there in just five minutes give me five minutes would you please just would you just give me five minutes are you kidding me i can fix that shit in five minutes five minutes that’s all most people want five minutes a good solid nice period of time you can do anything for five minutes can’t you i mean anything even things you really hate yeah you can probably do it for five minutes hey let’s go talk to ted are you kidding ted’s an asshole look just five minutes huh okay let’s give him five minutes not ten ten i can’t make now you’re getting into double digits you’re starting to fool with my head time five ten minutes fifteen minutes is popular you hear fifteen quite a bit but it’s it’s sort of an institutional one it’s kind of an official time period  minutes has a touch of regulatory uh quality to it doesn’t it it sounds like something you’re not supposed to do or have to do for  minutes fifteen minutes i like  minutes doesn’t that sound free compared to   minutes twenty minutes i’ll be back in  minutes gosh what’s he gonna dodo you have those news stories for me maybe

smoke he could not see and the dog led him out of the room down the hall and into an elevator shaft where he plunged eight stories to his deathi want to do a… a nostalgic thing here for my own sake and for the request of a couple of people that are on the crew that are listening or looking through viewers or listening on headsets or whatever and do a little uh weather forecast from al sleet al sleet the hippydippy weatherman hey baby what’s happening que pasa que what you call your pasa al sleet here your hippydippy weatherman with all the hippydippy weather man brought to you by parson’s pest control do you have termites waterbugs and roaches well parson’s will help you get rid of the termites and waterbugs and help you smoke the roaches hey temperature at the airport is  degrees which is stupid man cause i don’t know anybody who lives at the airport now if you’ll take a look at our national weather map you’ll see that we don’t have one so try to picture last night’s map in your mind remember all the letters and lines all them little numbers the weather is dominated by a large canadian low which is not to be confused with a mexican high tonight’s forecast dark continued dark tonight turning to partly light in the morning old al al got out of the weather business and he’s uh he’s now a a linoleum uh quality control inspector in a linoleum plant al he only wanted to get out of the media you know he said fuck it i don’t need it and uh hey who can blame him i don’t know but al got out of weather when he realized he had given the… the final weather forecast he had given the ultimate forecast there was nowhere to go you know when there’s nothing left to conquer in your field hey it’s time to leave and old al had given the ultimate forecast he told us he said one night that the weather will continue to change on and off for a long long time then he was gone from it god bless alokay yes you’re all you’re all going to die didn’t mean to remind you of it but it is on your schedule yes it probably won’t happen when you want it usually comes along when you’re not expecting generally you have your stamp collection out you know now now just want a little time to put away your hinges you know no there’s a time to die and it’s okay you know it’s really okay nobody wants to die nobody well you know ha ha most people don’t wanna die nobody wants to die boy if you think being sick is no fun dying is really a pain in the ass nobody wants to die people don’t mind being dead being dead is great but getting dead nobody wants to get dead so i hope i don’t die i wonder how often we think that you know it’s just under the surface isn’t it you go out for the day going out of your house geez i hope i don’t die it would really spoil the circus if i were to die geez i hope i don’t die comedians don’t wanna die it’s only a metaphor but it’s true of all of us we don’t wanna die out there a comic’s gonna die i don’t want to die geez i was dying out there i was dying it was death out there it was like a morgue i don’t wanna die of course if the comedian doesn’t die you know if he succeeds if he makes you laugh then he can say i killed ’em i killed ’em so it’s either me or you you know just like on the freeway yeah dying shouldn’t be that bad it shouldn’t be that bad we’re all gonna do it it’s one of the few fair things in life everybody catches it once and dying should be fun there should be some sort of a look ahead i mean after all when you die you’re gonna find out where you go haven’t we been wondering about that a long time where the hell we go isn’t that the biggest thing we have to wonder about where the hell do you go i don’t know joe thinks he knows i know joe thinks he knows but joe don’t know where do we go nobody knows well i think sometimes you go where you think you’re gonna go whatever you think you’re gonna do that’s where you’re probably gonna go if you keep saying you’re gonna go somewhere chances are you might go there you ever hear those guys say i’m going to hell don’t pray for me don’t pray for me i’m going to hell he is you go where you wanna go i think when you die your soul goes to a garage in buffalo when monte hall dies he’ll go behind door number  that’s it where you wanna go no nobody wants to die and you know part of the reason we don’t wanna die is because of that goddamn funeral we’ve seen it we know how bad news it is that funeral is no fun man if i don’t like other people’s funerals i know i’m not gonna like my own man there’s no way i can get behind my own funeral gonna be lying there in a casket they’re gonna put me in the box gonna put me in a convertible with the top down you know that’s embarrassing lying there and everybody’s looking at you you’re dead and they’re looking you’re just lying there still people coming over going… they don’t know that you’re lying there with short pants on and no back in your jacket embarrassing and sometimes they’ll come over you know some people it depends on your religion and so forth but they do come right over to the casket a lot of times and they’ll go like this and they’re silent for a moment and what they’re doing while they’re silent is they’re subtracting their age from your age so they get a rough estimate on what they have left and they get up and they say don’t he look good don’t he look good you crazy he’s dead i know but he never looked that good well they say the nicest things about you they say the nicest things when you die your popularity goes straight up when you die they say the greatest things there are that can be said they’ll even make stuff up if they have to well he was a real asshole but he meant well you know he was a wellmeaning asshole yes you get so popular when you die all the flowers you get think of the flowers you get when you die you get more flowers when you die than you got in your whole life all your flowers arrive at once too late and guys will say oh yeah well you know bill is dead yeah poor bill poor bill is dead yeah poor dave yeah poor dave is gone now ed yeah poor ed is gone dan that motherfucker is still alive isn’t he i wish he would die so i could like him reincarnation is another aspect of death that a lot of people will tell you little tales about it reincarnation coming back a lot of folks are sure of it they can come back you come back as something i don’t know does it seem right to you that it would work i mean mathematically it doesn’t seem to work because originally on this earth we only had well let’s say six people i know we had two but it’s a controversial number let’s say at one time there were only there were only six of us about six people six souls and those six people died and those souls went back to the staging area and new people were born and those six souls came back we still only have six souls now we have four billion people claiming to have souls where are all these extra souls coming from someone is printing up souls and it lowers their value the more souls there are the less they’re worth it would seem well somebody’s got to think of this shit you know how about the perfect murder i’ve thought sometimes about the perfect murder you know what you do you pick up one person by the ankles and you beat another person to death with him and they both die and there’s no murder weapon hey what happened here sergeant looks like a pedestrian accident to me they must have been moving at quite a clip of course if you should be caught with this perfect murder in progress or even after the fact if you should be caught you might wind up on death row death row wow that’s more than just fun ain’t it i mean there’s cats there death row man shit oh well you got that one meal but that’s not much of a consolation is it you’re gonna get to order your meal big deal why don’t you leave me alone i’m not hungry man they give you that one last meal i say you can have some fun with that last meal i mean if you work it right they gotta give you whatever you want i mean short of elephant steak you know they don’t wanna start on a new elephant just for one guy but they gotta give you pretty much what you want that’s part of the humanity of what they’re going to do to you yeah you could just order something you know like maybe well shit you tell them you can’t decide that’s it i can’t decide i don’t know i don’t know if i want steak or lobster you know i mean i really love them both and i honestly can’t decide could they kill you i don’t think they could kill you if you honestly couldn’t decide lie detector truth serum the man honestly doesn’t know what he wants we can’t very well kill him we can’t drag him down the last mile screaming i don’t know what i want you gotta give him a chance and then he… well man lives imagine if you worked it out and you kept it going six months man is still alive can’t decide on meal three years eight years and then finally you’re an honest person so you tell them when you do figure it out and you say i’ve decided what i’d like i think i’ll have steak okay how did you want that oh well my feeling is if you’re gonna die you know or if you know hey die big die big nobody wants to just pass away you don’t want to be a euphemism do you nobody wants to pass away you know arnie passed away oh really yes well i didn’t know that well that’s the idea on the other hand dave died oh yes i heard about dave dying that’s true i say die big give it a shot man go out big it’s your chance die big work in a few posthumous reflexes for your friends give them a show before you go entertain and uplift and instruct those you are leaving behind when you die give them a few posthumous reflexes you know the body does store electricity up there’s a certain storage of electricity and even a dead body a corpse will occasionally go sound and i say if you have that potential after you’re dead use it properly preprogram before you die preprogram some posthumous reflexes that will be entertaining to those you’ve left behind do something to capture their imagination roll over on the autopsy table that’s nice cross your legs scratch your balls do something now the only reason the only reason that i even suggest that you have a choice about what you can do at the moment of death is a very little known and very little understood part of the death process called the twominute warning many people are not aware of it at all the twominute warning just as in football two minutes before you die you receive an audible warning two minutes get your shit together the reason we don’t know about it is because the only people who hear it die and i don’t think we’d believe someone anyway if he told us he’d received his twominute warning would you some asshole on the bus hey i just got my twominute warning you’d think it was a coach out on the town you know but no the twominute warning does arrive and i say use that time to entertain to leave something behind do something with the two minutes hey if nothing else give a speech a little twominute speech we can all give a little twominute speech just pick some subject you’re very fond of and talk about it for two minutes i mean tell them it’s your last chance to tell them anything so tell them you got two minutes and i mean wax eloquent rise bring it to the rafters and then at the moment of the end you say if this is not the truth may god strike me deadwell that leads me into the filth and uh to kind of wind up thank you you know that’s the trouble with it is trying to decide what to call these words man i’m trying to decide what to call this whole thing you know what are these words that i’m talkin about they’re just words that we’ve decided sort of decided not to use all the time that’s about the only thing you could really say about them for sure that they’re just some words not many either just a few that we’ve decided well we won’t use them all the time sometimes well hell yeah sometimes it’s okay but not all the time and they’re the only words that seem to have that restriction i mean there are a lot of words you can say whenever you want you know pneumonia nobody gives you a lot of… all right you can’t yell it in the hospital a great deal but what the hell there are words that you can say no problem topography no one has ever gone to jail for screaming topography but there are some words that you can go to jail for there are some words that we just have decided we will not say all the time sometimes okay if you’re running through the jungle chasing somebody that we’re at war with you can holler them if you’re shooting a criminal it’s okay it’s the all american thing dirty fucking crook but if you’re with the bishop’s wife at lunch it’s better not to ask for the goddamn lettuce you know what i mean it’s just like we’ve decided there’d be some words we won’t say all the time and i was just trying to find out which words they were for sure all of them i wanted a list cause nobody gives you a list that’s the problem they don’t give you a list wouldn’t you think it would be normal if they didn’t want you to say something to tell you what it is nobody even tells you when you’re a kid what the words are that you’re supposed to avoid you have to say them to find out which ones they are shit ahhhh oh fuck ahhhh that’s two oh ma that’s enough trial and error huh please ma give me a list huh all right you’re six years old now and here’s the list of words your dad and i don’t ever want to hear you say oh hey thanks ma boy that’s gonna save me an ass kicking or two ahhhh ohhh yeah you never know what’s gonna be on the list cause it’s always somebody else’s list you didn’t make that up somebody told you that shit they told you better… better not say that so you’re gonna… and you don’t know what’s gonna be on their list god people’s lists even change from day to day some people on friday night got a list you know about two or three words sunday morning goddamn there’s  words on it these are the same people two days later different list so you’ve gotta kind of watch out what you’re gonna believe from them the trouble is i was trying to find out what these words might be and i wanted to know the ones that you could never say on television i mean the filthy words that are always filthy there are a lot of these little twoway double entendre words that have two meanings words that they’re okay part of the time i call them like parttime filth some of these words they’re only  percent dirty you have words like ass ass is hardly even a dirty word anymore but it has a few meanings that you can’t say on television that’s what i was talking about what can you say on television that’s another one of those places where we can’t use these words all the time but some of them are all right some of the time ass is all right on television you can say on television things like well you’ve made a perfect ass of yourself tonight but you can’t say hey let’s go get some ass bitch bitch is another word like that same kind of word it’s only dirty part of the time depends on what you mean by bitch you might be the lady from the san diego zoo visiting one of the tonight shows and you might just have a bunch of little canines with you there one of them is a female and you say there’s the bitch johnny and it’s okay fine just don’t refer to the singer the same way that’s all is that bitch gonna do another number yes animals are fine on those twoway words and that’s it that’s what i was trying to find the words that were always dirty not just part of the time but completely filth well in… in looking for these words i kept finding new categories we have so many ways of describing these dirty words it’s well we have more ways to describe dirty words than we actually have dirty words that seems a little strange to me it seems to indicate that somebody was awfully interested in these words they kept referring to them they called them bad words dirty filthy foul vile vulgar coarse in poor taste unseemly street talk gutter talk locker room language barracks talk bawdy naughty saucy raunchy rude crude lewd lascivious indecent profane obscene blue offcolor risque suggestive cursing cussing swearing and all i could think of was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits man that’s all we have shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits that was my original list i knew it wasn’t complete but it was a starter set you know …mention wbai shit piss fuck… yes wbai is the one who played them… shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits now that was the original list we’ve added a few words since then we’ve added fart turd and twat and i know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about why they haven’t been considered why they haven’t shown up on the list thus far we’re looking at them all very closely some of your favorites might make the list this year asshole ballbag hard on piss hard blue balls… nookie snatch box pussy pecker peckerhead peckertracks jism joint donicker dork poontang cornhole and dingleberry dingleberry a very popular word and to my way of thinking dingleberry a rather innocent sounding word dingleberry sounds christmasy to me you know let’s put one on the tree dad so the words as i say shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat now motherfucker came off the list immediately the first day in fact i had a call from an english language purist some guy had to he had to talk you know he got on the phone he tells me i have a duplicate on the list i have a duplication he says motherfucker is a duplication of the word fuck technically because fuck is the root form motherfucker being a derivative therefore it constitutes duplication and i said hey motherfucker how did you get my phone number anyway how did he know i even had a phone i said look man it may be a derivative but you still can’t say it you still can’t say motherfucker on tv can you he said no but you can’t say fuckee fucking fuckola fuckarooni or fuckarino either well i said yeah that would crowd up my list something awful so i just struck that motherfucker away i struck it from the list motherfucker was gone now the list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits does is sound like something’s missing does it sound like an old friend is gone shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits remember the old rhythm shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits now shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits it falls apart it isn’t going anywhere and by now cocksucker is the dominant word on the list previously with motherfucker on the list cocksucker was somewhat balanced out they were the only multisyllabic words on the list but now cocksucker stands alone shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits and who knows maybe it doesn’t belong either after all motherfucker turned out to be a ringer let’s take a look at cocksucker see if this one belongs we’ll divide the word cock and sucker from each other those words sucker isn’t dirty sucker it’s suggestive as hell but it isn’t dirty and cock that’s not dirty all the time that’s one of those words that’s only partly filthy cock if you’re talking about the animal it’s perfectly all right they used to read that to us from the bible in third grade and we would laugh man cock is in the bible remember the first time you heard about a cock fight what no get out of here get out of here even the word cocksucker itself has been twisted out of all of its original meaning it’s been distorted for some reason now cocksucker means bad man it’s a good woman how did they do that how did they do that well tits is on the end of the list shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and you know it doesn’t belong on that list i mean it really doesn’t belong in with that kind of heavyweight filth tits isn’t dirty tits is a cute name cute thing cute idea great fun good name tits hey tits sounds like a friend it sounds like a nickname doesn’t it hey tits come here man hey tits i want you to meet toots tits this is toots toots tits tits cute word nice word i love a word that spells the same forwards and backwards like tit don’t you think it’s cute when a word is spelled the same forwards and backwards i always wished my name was otto just so i could walk backwards and yell my name you know otto otto otto well i had strange dreams but the word tit is on the list because you can’t say it on television you can’t say tit imagine that can’t say tits you can say boobs boob is spelled the same forwards and backwards too boobs is all right you can’t say tits but you can say boobs in fact boobs is an answer now on match game i had boobs gene boobs  tits  fine maybe you can’t say tits you can say teats teats is all right providing you’re on at  in the morning and a cow is your guest but you can’t say jugs and you can’t say knockers you know that’s right danny pull on the cow’s knockers right grab a knocker in each hand that a boy now alternate knockers good deal you can’t say that tits tits sounds like a snack you know well i know what you’re thinking but tits sounds almost it sounds nabisco to me it sounds like nabisco has… has reserved that name cause tits sounds like a thing at a party pass the tits would you bill say those things are… responding well shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat fart fart is like tit it’s one of those words that isn’t that harmful you know it’s just a cute kind of a thing farts well farts can be a little harmful it depends it depends on who’s cooking but fart fart is a cute… hey kids know farts are okay kids know farts are fun farts are shit without the mess wow yeah same funny sound same vile smell no fuss no muss fart is an interesting word in this respect talking about television fart is extremely interesting because dig this you can’t say fart on television we know that you can’t say fart and you can’t say fuck either on television however you can refer to fucking you can talk about fucking they do that all the time some of the times in the show you’re watching two people are probably fucking in the other room fucking is all right fucking is part of the plot a lot of plots are based on fucking will they fuck should they fuck have they fucked did they fuck will they fuck again will they get sick from fucking are they fucking too much will they fuck each other’s friends will they have a baby from fucking will they be sorry they fucked will they be glad they fucked all fuck stories every honeymoon joke is a fuck joke have you ever noticed it otherwise the people wouldn’t be on their honeymoon in the joke they’d be knights or they’d sailors or something they’re on their honeymoon it’s got to be a fuck joke every little every news… i’m sorry… every quiz master has stood there with his newlywed couple and said and i understand you folks are on your honeymoon lots of fucking going on here lots of fucking over here so they talk about fucking all they want they just don’t call it that they don’t call it what it is they call it other things they call it making love which is fine they call it going to bed with someone having an affair sleeping together but they don’t call it fucking on the other hand fart not only is fart a word you can’t use on television but they never even refer to them that’s how bad farts are compared to fucking they don’t even refer to farts there are no farts on television you’ve never seen a reference to a fart i’ve never seen a fart reference no wouldn’t you think that by now one guy would have gone whew whew do you think by now that one guy on the johnny carson panel just once would have said hey ed move down man whew wow that was a clydesdale fart ed give me the lighter will ya johnny wow geez ed next time you’re sick you ought to see the nurse you know god it’s not the smell so much it’s the burning of my eyes well we might live to see that you never know remember when you were a kid and maybe you were a little boy child like me you had on short pants maybe sitting in church sitting on a wooden bench in church in the middle of the summer with short pants you gotta fart you know and it’s up to you you gotta work out a little maneuver that’s called the one cheek sneak right in tune with the organ that’s why they call them pews you know whew whew whew did you ever notice that your own farts smell okay say that’s fairly decent i think i’ll stay home today do some reading in the closet now i mentioned the three extra words fart turd and twat turd is another word you can’t say on television turd but you know when you get right down to it who wants to say it i don’t even care if i ever hear that one again twat twat is on the list for the same reason it doesn’t mean anything else you know it only has that one meaning twat’s twat and that’s that it’s not like prick prick is one of those parttime dirty words prick is all right you can say prick on television you can say i pricked my finger just don’t say you fingered your prick that’s all now there are two words left which i will wind this thing up with one of them is not uh dirty all the time one of them is ball or balls is a word that’s mostly clean it has many clean meanings but… but it has a couple of meanings that might get you in trouble and ball is one of those words you gotta think about how you’re gonna say it and maybe you have to watch out for just a moment but it’s okay for sports people perfectly all right when you’re a kid you grow up they tell ya go play with your ball really but it’s okay for the sports announcer on the game of the week to tell you that pete rose has two balls on him no problem at all the whole country nods in agreement but the announcer can’t tell you that he hurt his balls he can’t tell tony kubeck tony i think he hurt his balls on that play it looks like it he’s holding onto them well that’s right generally when they hurt their balls they hold them and he’s holding his and i’d say he’s hurt them never mention ball injuries they don’t say the balls were hurt they say groin injuries he had a groin injury do you know why we call it a groin injury that’s the noise you make when you get hit there groin now then the other word i wanted to remind you of was the word fuck which of course is the champ of the alltime dirty words when they’re always dirty by god fuck is right at the head of the pack fuck’s a good strong word it’s a good strong word for its purpose and it’s a word that a lot of people have trouble with uh it’s a… it’s an honest word it’s a… it’s a forceful word it has a lot of emotional baggage with it when you hear the word fuck you’re not just hearing the word you’re hearing everything you ever heard about fucking i mean we have a lot of attitudes about fucking some of them are rationale and some of them aren’t some of them have joy in them some have guilt and fear and all sorts of things and the word fuck carries with it a lot of emotional baggage when they say fuck you go what oh oh good oh i thought you meant do it right away god you know it’s uh it’s just a word that that well it’ll clear the room awfully quick in some households it’s a heavy good strong word it’s a proud sounding word to me fuck fuck i am fuck who are you fuck of the mountain i just uh i just feel the word is getting a bad shake the word has an image problem the word fuck needs public relations help it’s just a word you know that’s what you have to remember it’s just a word but it’s in such bad shape here’s a word that started out okay it started out all right nothing wrong with the word fuck originally i mean there it was you’re not a bad word you’re not a bad word you’ve just gotten in with bad company people that’s all just the word was all it was the word in the original old english as best i can find fuck only meant to hit to smite to… to perhaps hit with a stick to fuck the tree to fuck the rock to fuck thee that’s all and pretty soon that’s all i’ll hit you with my dick honey look at that that’s all it was just a little i’ll knock a little fuck on you there that’s all it was was a love tap when you get right down to it that’s all fuck ever meant all fuck ever meant was to make love and to make life at the same time that’s pretty magic i mean pretty noble things we think about making love and making life here was fuck hanging around with words like love and life how did it get such a bad reputation we fucked it up yeah well we… we put the aggression back into the word fuck you fuck you you fuck fuck you you fuck who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with some kind of a fuckhead fuck you who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with me don’t fuck with me i’ll fuck over you you fuck with me and you’ll get fucked you fuck don’t fuck with me i’m the fucker don’t fuck with the fucker god it sounds like combat man it’s got an awful lot there’s an awful lot of hostility in the way that word is used there’s an awful lot of aggression going down in the name of fucking imagine that i’d just like to help a little my feeling was hey here’s a word that uh maybe we could save you know just by paying a little close attention to it the trouble is with all that aggression and all that violence that we lose track of those two things and people start talking about sex and violence like they’re one thing there’s some sort of an overlapping there’s some sort of a gray area between sex and violence that some people really are confused about there are people running around talking about sex and violence as if it’s one thing as if it starts with an s and ends with a e we’re gonna stamp it out of the comics we’re gonna stamp it out of the dixie cup we’re gonna stamp it out of homes sex and violence hey they are different after all and some people even like them together there are true people who do like a little violence with their sex i’m not… i don’t care for that myself i like my violence a little earlier in the afternoon you know right around  o’clock a real good ass kicking and then everything’s all right but uh the word make love not war someone pointed it out finally they made it very clear for us make love not war i wish i had thought of that phrase you know i really would have been very happy with myself if i had thought of that one man i would have retired the same day i would have left my car at the red light man i’d say that’s it folks i’m going to the beach you got it make love not war well i didn’t think of it but i do have my own phrase make fuck not kill it’s not as graceful a phrase but i’m not looking to retire either the whole idea of make fuck not kill is simply to switch the meanings of the words i suggest that for one year we trade meanings on fuck and kill just fuck for kill and kill for fuck that’s it don’t worry about what they really are someone else will take care of real fucking and real killing i’m just worried about what we call it… them we call them fucking and killing i say switch them around i think it would be an insight i think we’d get a new slant on how we feel about these words if we just change fucking for killing for about a year that’s all imagine it sure would be fun watching tv during that time huh better get down off the horse sheriff we’re fixing to fuck you now mad fucker still on the loose not anymore he’s made his first big mistake my friend he fucked a cop today that makes him a cop fucker pardon me boys my horse broke his leg i’m gonna have to fuck him i’ll be right back shamu the fucker whale and to fuck a mockingbird hold gently by the wings so all i’m trying to suggest is that fuck you can be a positive phrase if you hear it from across the street… fuck you okayand thank you for being a part of this and i mean it a lot and i thank the people that aren’t here tonight that were here the other two nights and there’s an awful lot of people to thank but i want to do one thing before i go any

lot but i have some notes over here and uh the reason for that is i havent been doing this lately i want to make sure i know and remember everything tonight ive been taking a little time off six months i think i took uh three of them uh quite voluntarily and the other three quite against my will i had a heart attack or as they say in boston i had a heart attack he had a heart attack you hear about george he had a goddamn myocardial infarction i had a heart attack fortunately my pharmacist my cardiologist and my doctor give me cpr but i would like to bring you up to date uh on the comedians health sweepstakes as it stands right now i lead richard prior in heart attacks two to one i am ahead i am ahead thats right now however richard still leads me one to nothing on burning yourself up well the way it happened was first richard had a heart attack then i had a heart attack then richard burned himself up then i said fuck that im gonna have another heart attacki had an interesting morning got into an argument\\u2026 got into an argument with my rice krispies i distinctly heard snap crackle fuck him i dont know which one of them said it i was reaching for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl but i told them i said well you can all just sit right there in the milk far as im concerned you can sit in the milk until i find out which one of you said that a little mass punishment for my breakfast food the idea is to turn them against one another just sit in the milk far as im concerned silly me big punishment thats what they do anyway sit in the milk thats their job thats rice krispies job sitting in the milk youve seen them havent you floating along little beige blisters of air riding proudly in the milk but you cant sink them they float for a long time and you know why they stay together they gather together in little groups little groups of eight ten twelve sometimes fourteen but always an even number if youve noticed its the polarity of the krispies that attracts them they form little colonies of rice krispies but you cant sink them you try to sink them with a spoon they come up over the sides you cant sink them thats what the fruit is for sinking the rice krispies good size peach will take down  or  of them if im really pissed ill drop a watermelon on thembut i say interesting about my morning cause it was its not\\u2026 i dont have a nice day anymore i dont bother much with that i think im beyond that now i think ive outgrown the nice day i think ive had my share why should i be hogging

mouse with gloves and a parka on you know just\\u2026 just waiting for the lights to go out so he can get back to work i guess the worst thing that can happen cleaning out or looking through the refrigerator is to come across\\u2026 something\\u2026 that you cannot identify\\u2026 at all you literally do not know what it is it could be meat it could be cake usually at a time like that ill bluff honey is this good well what is it i dont know ive never seen anything like it it looks like meatcake well smell it actually it has no smell whatsoever its good put it back somebody is saving it

people dont know that they say hitler geez he had a lot of balls\\u2026 onefor some time i was trying to get a list of words together that would fairly represent the dirty words cause nobody gives you a list of dirty words for life have you noticed that theres some words that are perfectly clean but sound like they could be filthy if you gave them just a little help a word like pussyfoot its perfectly clean but when you say pussyfoot theres a little giggle cause people know that with a little help this word could be filthy no matter what form of the verb you try its clean as a verb but pussyfoot could be a noun it could be a noun pussyfoot a rare disorder a female birth defect hello boys i have pussyfoot god you sure do lady and i love them opentoed shoes you have on well id rather have pussyfoot than woodpecker i can say thator beer nuts god that must be awful beer nuts the official disease of milwaukee i know whenever i see the little canister behind the bar i drop in a couple of dollars for beer nuts i think we need a lot more research on beer nuts or cotton balls which is the dreaded final stage of beer nuts when my beer nuts turn to cotton balls ill be heading home to you its an old southern hymnlots of little phrases like that in the language that dont quite say what they mean take a shit is another one take a shit you dont take shit you leave a shit thats the whole idea to leave it i left a shit fine thank you jeff whered you leave it in the icebox im gonna take a shit dont take one of mine i only have two left and the weekend is coming up why dont you go home and take one of your own shits guys always mooching off me he must think im made of shit or something boy that shit dont grow on trees you know well enough of that shit lots of little phrases like thatpick your nose is well blow your nose blow your nose is a phrase imagine that blowing your nose i dont believe they really mean that do you you cant blow your nose i believe its physically impossible to blow your nose you might get somebody else to blow your nose but it would have to be a real good friendcocktails another clean word you can advertise them you can put up signs all over town cocktails as long as you use both halves of the word perfectly fine but you cant advertise either one of those two items if you break those words in half theyll come and take your sign down cocktail its okay it depends on how you say that kind of word you ladies like some cocktails hey lady you want a cocktailcockpit men will actually laugh about that cockpit get it oh yeahbangkok theres a lovely city how would you like to be a hooker in bangkok it would seem like a natural habitatpeacock nbc is really proud of their peacock you know what a female peacock is a peacuntmy list i was just trying to isolate the words that were always filthy not the ones that were sometimes dirty and the original list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits this was all i could think of in one sitting just one try but we had to add some we had shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and then we added fart turd and twat which also dont have other meanings you know twats twat and thats that but after a while it didnt take long well it took quite a while but i finally discovered that there are only two words on the list you really had to deal with to sort of look at the double standard that television uses where language is concerned uh the two words were fart and fuck those are the only two they seem similar because you cant say either one of them you cant say fart and you cant say fuck no matter how cleverly you try to work them in no matter how clinical the conversation is fart and fuck will not show up on the final tape you simply cannot say them but thats where the similarity ends cause at least with the word fuck even though you cant say the word fuck you can talk about fucking oh you can refer to fucking theres lots of fuck talk going on on tv they just dont call it fucking thats the secret they dont use that word theres plenty of fuck talk you see people who wrote a book about fucking youll see a guy on a talk show who wrote a book about fucking how to fuck who to fuck when to fuck why to fuck and how to feel after you fuck this man is a fuck expert and he wrote a fuck book and hes talking to merv griffin about fucking and theyre getting away with it cause they dont call it fucking same with the soap operas everybody you take a look at a soap opera and you know everybody is fucking somebody on a soap opera and if theyre not fucking somebody theyre trying to fuck somebody will he fuck her did he fuck her has he fucked her should he fuck her can he fuck her some more will they fuck too much will they get silly from fucking who is fucking who thats all you want to know is what the fuck is going on on this program here you know that somebody is getting fucked and you think its you so theres lots of fuck talk and theres plenty of fucking on television they just dont call it fucking they call it everything elsenow on the other hand farts not only can you not mention the word fart but you cant refer to farts at all thats how bad farts are theyre worse than fucking you never hear anybody talking about farts on tv youve never seen a guy who wrote a book on farts how to fart who to fart at how to feel after you fart theres no fart experts on the merv griffin show you dont see any farts or fart references its a fart free zone wouldnt you think after  years one guy by now would have gone whew just once just once id like to see someone on the johnny carson panel say hey ed move down man that was a clydesdale fartwell anyway uh after a while i realized that i was needlessly restricting myself to seven words and only to the ones that werent allowed on tv i mean there were a lot more to be looked at and television isnt the only place that objects to your language sometimes there are lots of situations where youre not supposed to say that so i expanded the list by as many as i could and id like to share some with you now this list is a little longer than it was before first we start with the ones we already know shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat crap balls prick asshole jackoff jerkoff scumbag douche bag hardon rodon boner stiff piss hard blue balls

    \"i know im a little late with this but id like to get a few licks on this totally bogus topic before it completely disappears from everyones consciencesfirst i want to be really clear about one thing as far as other peoples feeling are concerned\\u2014especially these victim groups\\u2014when i deal with them as individuals i will call them whatever they want when its one on one if some guy wants me to call him a morbidly obese africanancestored male with a same gendered sexual orientation ill be glad to do that one the other hand if he wants me to call him a fat ngger  than thats what it will be im here to pleaseif i meet a woman who wishes to be to be referred to as a motionimpaired same genderoriented italianamerican who is difficult to deal with fine on the other hand i am perfectly willing to call her a crippled guinea  cnt if she prefers im not trying to change anyones self image but but when i am speaking generally and impersonally about a large group of people i will call them what i think is honest and fair and i will not try and bullshit myselfokay so who exactly are these victims well first of all i dont think everyone who says he is a victim automatically qualifies i dont think a homely disfigured bald minority person with a room temperature iq who limps and stutters is necessarily always a victim although i will say that she probably shouldnt be out trying to get work as a receptionist but maybe thats just the way it oughtta beim more interested in the real victims people who have been fucked over by the system because the united states is a christian racist nation with a rigged economic system run for three hundred years by the least morally qualified of the two sexes there were bound to be some real victims people who have been elaborately fucked overthe way i see it this country has only four real victim groups indians blacks women and gays i purposely left out the spanish and asians because when you look at what happened to the indians and the blacks the spanish and asian people had a walk in the park its not even close not to downplay the shit theyve had to eat but in about one hundred years the spanish and asians are going to be running this country so theyll have plenty of chances to get even with the gray peoplelets get to some of these other nonvictims you probably noticed elsewhere i used the word fat i used that word because thats what fat people are theyre fat theyre not large theyre not stout chunky hefty or plump and theyre not bigboned dinosaurs are bigboned these people are not necessarily obese either obese is a medical term and theyre not overweight overweight implies there is some correct weight there is no correct weight heavy is also a misleading term an aircraft carrier is heavy it is not fat only people are fat thats what fat people are theyre fat i offer no apology for this it is not intended as criticism or insult it is simply descriptive language i dont like euphemisms euphemisms are a form of lying fat people are not gravitationally disadvantaged theyre fat i prefer seeing things the way they are not the way some people wish they werei dont believe groups deserve extraspecial names for instance midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they are not little people infants are little people leprechauns are little people  midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they dont get any taller by calling them little people i wish their lives were different i wish they didnt have to go around starring at other peoples crotches but i cant fix that and im not going to lie about what they are the politically sensitive commandos would probably like me to call them vertically challenged they are not vertically challenged a skydiver is vertically challenged the person who designed the empire state building was vertically challenged midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfsalso crippled people are crippled they are not differentlyabled if you insist on using such tortured language as differentlyabled then you must use it on all of us were all differentlyabled you can do things i cant do i can do things you cant do i can pick my nose with my thumb i can switch hands while masturbating and gain a stroke we are all differentlyabled crippled people are crippled its a perfectly honorable word there is no shame in it its in the bible jesus healed the cripples he didnt engage in rehabilitative strategies for the physically disadvantagedso leaving women and gays aside for a moment ive narrowed it down to blacks and indians lets talk about what we ought to call them and remember this has nothing to do with the people themselves it has to do with the wordsand by the way when it comes to liberal language vandals i must agree with there underlying premise white europeans and their descendants are morally unattractive people who are responsible for most of the worlds suffering that part is easy you would have to be uh visually impaired not to see it the impulse behind political correctness is a good one but like every good impulse in america it has to be grotesquely distorted beyond usefulnessclearly these are victims but i dont agree that these failed campus revolutionaries know what to do about them when theyre not busy curtailing freedom of speech theyre running around inventing absurd hyphenated names designed to make people feel better remember these are the white elitists in there customary paternalistic role protecting helpless inept minority victims  big daddy white boss always knows bestso let me tell you how i handle some of these speech issues first of all i say black i say black because most black people prefer black i dont say people of color people of color sounds like something you see when you are on mushrooms besides the use of people of color is dishonest it means precisely the same thing as colored people if youre not willing to say colored people you shouldnt be saying people of colorbesides the whole idea of color is bullshit anyway what should we call white people people of no color isnt pink a color in fact white people arent really white at all theyre different shades of pink olive and beige in other words theyre colored and black people are rarely black i see mostly different shades of brown and tan in fact some lightskinned black people are lighter than the darkest white people look how dark the people in india are theyre dark brown but theyre still considered white people whats going on here may i see the color chart people of color is an awkward bullshit  liberalguilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it shall we call fat people people of sizeby the way i think the whole reason we are encouraged in this country to think of ourselves as black and white instead of pink and brown which is what we are is that black and white are complete opposites that cannot be reconciled black and white can never come together pink and brown on the other hand might just stand a chance of being blended might just come together cant have that doesnt fit the plani also dont say africanamerican i find it completely confusing which part of africa are we talking about what about egypt egypt is in africa egyptians arent black theyre like the people in india theyre the dark brown white people but theyre africans so why wouldnt an egyptian who becomes a us citizen be an africanamericanthe same thing goes for the republic of south africa suppose a white racist from south africa becomes an american citizen well first of all hed find plenty of company but couldnt he also be called an african american it seems to me that a racist white southafrican guy could come here and call himself africanamerican just to piss off black people and by the way what about a black person born in south africa who moves here and becomes a citizen what is he is he a africansouthafricanamerican or a southafricanafricanamerican all right back to the hemisphere how about a black women who is a citizen of jamaica according to pc doctrine shes africanjamaican right but if she becomes a us citizen shes a jamaicanamerican and yet if one of these language crusaders saw her on the street hed think she was africanamerican unless he knew her personally in which case hed have to decide between africanjamaicanamerican and jamaicanafricanamerican ya know its just so much liberal bullshit labels divide people we need fewer labels not morei am an army brat  that is someone who doesnt really belong anywhere anymore but has to fake it their entire life that they do  but now i find that i am in the vanguard of the culture  so many americans have the same experience of being displaced and not belonging anywhere because of the widespread moving away from ones roots that it has become normal  so to feel we have roots we turn to things like pop music which is now commercialized  so our roots are not roots at all but we are just consumers being manipulated by our own

to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife huh who her oh hell yeah well its one of lifes little moments isnt it its one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time you cant postpone that you cant put that off and be walking around like this youve got to get in there and clear that thing out youve got to rescue your underwear theres a letter in your mailbox thats right and you have to rectify that situation so that you can move along to your next embarrassing moment which is probably scheduled immediately thats the way life is full of those little moments everybody knows them everybody recognizes them you ever been at a really loud party i mean a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly and in order to be heard even by the person standing right next to you youve got to be screaming at the top of your lungs but every now and then at a party it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time and only your voice can be heard right i know i know well what im going to do im going to have my testicles laminated lifes little moments you ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt and you have to just kind of keep talking you know and make believe its part of the design works all right if youre wearing a hawaiian shirt but otherwise theyre going to notice ed you got a big snot on your shirt some guys are really cruel you know and some of these things are not even your fault these little things that happen you didnt cause the situation a lot of time youre the victim you walk into some situation and suddenly youre the one whos taking all the heat not your fault give you an example of the kind of thing i mean did you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guys hand and you suddenly realize he doesnt have a complete hand and you got to make believe it feels great right you cant go ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhhh you cant do that its not even an option you got to hang in there and say hi hey swell hand give me three hi  yo not your fault you didnt cause that you werent even there when it happened to the guyyou were probably out walking your dog which is what im usually doing walking my dog because i love my dog i love all my dogs i love every dog i ever had i remember them all and i love every one of them still love all my dogs and ive had me a lot of god damn dogs in my lifetime i have had me a bunch of different dogs because you do keep getting a new dog dont you you just keep getting one dog after another thats the whole secret of life life is a series of dogs its true you just keep getting a new dog dont you thats whats good about them they dont live too long and you can go get a new god damn dog sometimes you can get a dog looks exactly like the dog you used to have right you shop around a little bit you can find a dog identical to your former dog and thats real handy because you dont have to change the pictures on your mirror or anything right you just bring the dead one into the pet shop throw him up on the counter say give me another one of them that was real good and theyll give you a carbon copy of your exgod damn dog now my favorite dog that i ever had in my whole lifetime was tippie tippie was a good dog some of you remember ive talked about tippie tippie was a good dog tippie was a mixed terrier you know that word mixed that the veterinarian puts on the form when even he dont know what the fuck you got you bring in a little mixed puppy to a veterinarian and say what is it hell say well its definitely not a monkey tippie was actually part dodge dart poor tippie was full of guilt so much so in fact shes the only dog i ever had who committed suicide yeah well we dont say it like that around the house we say she put herself to sleep but she ran out in front of a milk truck thats fucking suicide but that was her decision thats what tippie wanted to do and thats the way it is in our family if you want to commit suicide we back you up so we supported tippie in her little suicide decision then we brought her into the pet shop threw her up on the counter and said give us something bigger were trading up we was looking for a bigger god damn dog because tippie had been teenie even before the truck came by the truck had made her teenier wider but teenier and we was looking for a bigger god damn dog not too big you know i dont like a dog whos bigger than i am its bad enough looking for shit in one direction without having to duck flying turds as well a good rule of thumb is keep the dogs asshole below eye level so we compromised and we got us a midsized dog knee high just about like this size here best size you can own by the way most people know this is the ideal size dog to have you know why anybody comes to visit you the first thing that dog does is take his nose and put it right in their crotch oohh oohh he smells my dog no marge i dont believe thats the animal he has in mind and people get embarrassed by that especially the owner of the dog the owners the one whos saying stop that stop that will you stop that now stop it im awfully sorry about this not me i say get in there and get some of that get in there and sniff that thing out go on listen would you mind spreading your legs a little bit so he can get right in there yeah stand like this for a little while would you okay looking good now so hows your mom and dad doing anyway well god bless them its a wonderful couple go around the back check it out in the back sniff that other thing in the back there whats that well theres two different smells he likes what can i tell you dont pay him no attention hell be finished in just about half an hour so listen reverend its real nice of you to come and call on us like this every one of us is always glad to see you around here especially that god damn dog those dogs are great theyll break the ice when a new neighbor comes to call hi were the johnsons whats his name ball sniffer hes a crotch hound let me know if you want to get circumcised hes on duty till  oclock dogs are a constant source of entertainment did you ever have a dog that ate cat turds some of them do some of you must know that did you ever have a dog eat cat turds yeah of course you got to have a cat you know you cant be buying cat turds at the supermarket but its true some dogs will eat cat turds yeah dont let them lick you that day get a bottle of listerine for him try to make him gargle pour it down his throat and tell him to howl come on howl howl god damn it stomp on his tail howl i said god damn it howl oh dogs are a lot of fun did you ever have a dog that ate a bunch of colored balloons and then he takes a shit and its real decorative like or sometimes at christmas theyll eat some tinsel and take a shiny shit wow look mom can we hang it on the tree well it is considered good luck in some cultures heres a little household hint for you this will help you clean up after your dogs feed your dog a lot of rubber bands put a lot of rubber bands in with his regular food then when he takes a shit theres usually a little loop in the end of it you just pick it up by the loop do you know what i mean throw it in the neighbors yard yeah thats why i travel around give these little household hints bet you never read that one in heloise huhyeah about time for me to get a little drink of water figure this stuff is safe to drink huh actually i dont care if its safe or not i drink it anyway you know why because im an american and i expect a little cancer in my food and water thats right im a loyal american and im not happy unless ive let government and industry poison me a little bit every day let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here ah a little cancer never hurt anybody everybody needs a little cancer i think its good for you keeps you on your toes besides i aint afraid of cancer i had broccoli for lunch broccoli kills cancer a lot of people dont know that its not out yet its true you find out you got some cancer get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli thatll wipe it right out in a day or two cauliflower too cauliflower kills the really big cancers the ones you can see through clothing from across the street broccoli kills the little ones the ones that are slowly eating you away from inside while your god damn goofy halfeducated doctor keeps telling you youre doing fine jim in fact bring your doctor a bowel of broccoli hes probably got cancer too probably picked it up from you they dont know what theyre doing its all guesswork in a white coat here let me have a few more sips of industrial waste ah maybe maybe i can turn them cancers against one another thats what you got to hope for you know that you get more than one cancer so they eat each other up instead of you in fact the way i look at it the most cancer you got the healthier you are well i know some people dont like you to talk about those things i know that some people dont like you to mention certain things some people dont want you to say this some people dont want you to say that some people think if you mention some things they might happensome people are really fucking stupid did you ever notice that how many really stupid people you run into during the day god damn theres a lot of stupid bastards walking around carry a little pad and pencil with you you wind up with  or  names by the end of the day look at it this way think of how stupid the average person is and then realize half of them are stupider than that and it doesnt take you very long to spot one of them does it take you about eight seconds youll be listening to some guy and say this guy is fucking stupid then then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre full of shit huh that doesnt take very long to spot either does it take you about the same amount of time youll be listening to some guy saying well hes fairly intelligent ah hes full of shit then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre not full of shit theyre fucking nuts dan quayle is all three all three stupid full of shit and fucking nuts and where did he get that wife of his have you taken a good look at that marilyn quayle where did he get her at a halloween party or something she looks like prince charles for christs sake let me ask you something does he actually have to fuck that woman huh god help him i wouldnt fuck her with a stolen dickthats my political humor people like it when youre topical oh some people dont like you to talk like that oh some people would like to shut you up for saying those things you know that lots of people lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk tell you what you cant talk about sometimes theyll say well you can talk about something but you cant joke about it say you cant joke about it because its not funny comedians run into that shit all the time like rape theyll say you cant joke about rape rapes not funny i say fuck you i think its hilarious how do you like that i can prove to you that rape is funny picture porky pig raping elmer fudd see hey why do you think they call him porky huh i know what youre going to say elmer was asking for it elmer was coming on to porky porky couldnt help himself he got a hardon he got horny he lost control he went out of his mind lot of men talk like that lot of men think that way they think its the womans fault they like to blame the rape on the woman say hey she had it coming she was wearing a short skirt these guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers dont seem fair to me dont seem right but you can joke about it i believe you can joke about anything it all depends on how you construct the joke what the exaggeration is what the exaggeration is because every joke needs one exaggeration every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion give you an example did you ever see a news story like this is the paper every now and then you run into a story that says some guy broke into a house stole a lot of things and while he was in there he raped an  old woman and im thinking to myself why what the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have i want to say why did you do that well she was coming on to me we were dancing and i got horny hey she was asking for it she had on a tight bathrobe i say jesus christ be a little fucking selective next time will you now speaking of rape you know what i wonder i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole these are the kind of things i think about when im sitting home alone and the power goes out i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole i mean per capita i know the populations are different most people think its the equator i think its the north pole people think its the equator because its hot down there they dont wear a lot of clothing guys can see womens tits they get horny and theres a lot of fucking going on thats exactly why theres less rape at the equator because theres a lot of fucking going on you can tell theres a lot of fucking at the equator take a look at the population figures billions of people life near the equator how many eskimos we got   no ones getting laid at the north pole its too fucking cold guys say to their wives hey tonight honey huh tonight huh are you crazy the wind chill factor is  below these guys are deprived theyre horny theyre pent up every now and then they bust out they got to rape somebody now the biggest problem an eskimo rapist has trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman whos kicking did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesnt want to take them off you would lose your hard on in the process up at the north pole your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes thats another thing i wonder i wonder does a rapist have a hard on when he leaves the house in the morning or does he develop it during the day when hes walking around looking for somebody these are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schoolsnow i probably got the feminists all pissed off at me because im joking about rape feminists want to control your language feminists want to tell you how to talk and theyre not alone theyre not alone im not picking on the feminists they got a lot of company in this country theres a lot of groups lot of institutions in this country want to control your language tell you what you can say and what you cant say government wants to tell you some things you cant say because theyre against the law or you cant say this because its against a regulation or heres something you cant say because its a secret you cant tell him that because hes not cleared to know that government wants to control information and control language because thats the way you control thought and basically thats the game theyre insame with religion religion is nothing but mind control religion is just trying to control your mind control your thoughts so theyre going to tell you some things you shouldnt say because theyre sins and besides telling you things you shouldnt say religions going to suggest to you some things you ought to be saying heres something you ought to say first thing when you wake up in the morning heres something you ought to say just before you go to sleep at night heres something we always say on the third wednesday in april after the first full moon in spring at  when the bells ring religion is always suggesting things you ought to be saying same with political groups of all kinds political activists antibiased groups special interest groups are going to suggest the correct political vocabulary the way you ought to be saying things and thats where the feminists come innow as i said i got nothing against the feminists in fact i happen to agree with most of the feminist philosophy i have read i agree for instance that for the most part men are vain ignorant greedy brutal assholes whove just about ruined this planet\\u2026 whove just about ruined this planet because theyre afraid someone might have a bigger dick out there somewhere men are basically insecure about the size of their dicks and so they go to war over it you dont have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work it goes something like this what they have bigger dicks bomb them and of course the bombs and the bullets and the rockets are all shaped like dicks i dont understand that part of it but it is part of the equation so i agree with that abstract that man men males have pushed the technology that just about has this planet in a stranglehold mother earth raped again guess who eh she was asking for it i also happen to like it when feminists attack these fat ass housewives who think theres nothing more to life than sitting home on the telephone drinking coffee watching tv and pumping out a baby every nine months ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom will seven be enough bob ba boom ba boom but whats the alternative whats the alternative to pumping out a unit every nine months pointless careerism putting on a man tailored suit with shoulder pads and imitating all the worst behavior of men this is the noblest thing that women can think of to take a job in a criminal corporation thats poisoning the environment and robbing customers out of their money this is the worthiest thing they can think of isnt there something nobler they can do to be helping this planet heal you dont hear much about that from these middle class women ive noticed that most of these feminists are white middle class women they dont give a shit about black womens problems they dont care about latino women all theyre interested in is their own reproductive freedom and their pocketbooks but when it comes to changing the language i think they make some good points because we do think in language and so the quality of our thoughts and ideas could only be as good as the quality of our language so maybe some of this patriarchal shit ought to go away i think spokesmen ought to be spokesperson i think chairman ought to be chairperson i think mankind ought to be humankind but they take it too far they take themselves too seriously the exaggerate they want me to call that thing in the street a person hole cover i think thats taking it a little bit too far what would you call a ladys man a persons person that would make a heman an it person little kids would be afraid of the boogie person theyd look up in the sky and see the person in the moon guys would say come back here and fight like a person and wed all sing for its a jolly good person thats the kind of thing you would hear on late night with david letterperson you know what i mean so i think its an exaggeration and i like to piss off any group that takes itself a little bit too seriously and it does not take a lot of imagination to piss off a feminist all you got to do is run into now headquarters or ms magazine and say hey which one of you cute little cupcakes wants to come home and cook me a nice meal and give me a blow job blow job oh that pisses them off you want to piss off a feminist call her a cum catcher thatll get her attention ah dont act disgusted dont act disgusted half of you are going to go home and go down on each other tonight remember if youre willing to swallow cum lets not make believe something i said was disgusting okay all right lets not have a double standard here one standard will do just finenow speaking of blowjobs do you know why they call it a blowjob so itll sound like it has kind of a work ethic attached to it make you feel like you did something useful for the economy long as im being a complete pig up here let me ask you guys a question let me ask one question of the men are you ever able to watch a woman eating a banana and not think about a blowjob huh i cant do it i cant do it and i know why im a sick evil fuck i know that i accept that but i cant do it eating a banana eating a pickle licking on an ice cream cone im saying to myself look at the tongue on her wow so you women be careful when youre standing out in front of that hagen daas because god damn it were watching and god damn it were thinking another womans issue prostitution i do not understand why prostitution is illegal why should prostitution be illegal selling is legal fucking is legal why isnt selling fucking legal you know why should it be illegal to sell something thats perfectly legal to give away i cant follow the logic on that at all of all the things you can do too a person giving someone an orgasm is hardly the worst thing in the world in the army they give you a medal for spraying napalm on people civilian life you go to jail for giving someone an orgasm maybe im not supposed to understand iti got strange ideas anyway you know what i think they ought to do with that miss american contest i think they ought to make the losers keep coming back until they win ill tell you that would get a little spooky after about  years or so huh i just want to work on world peace fine sit down before you fall down will you and pick up all these goddamn batons i got a lot of ideas you know what i think i think kleenex ought to have little targets on them wouldnt that be a good idea little bulls eyes right in the middle of the kleenex make it kind of sporting when youre with your friends blowing nose sound look dave an  thats a good idea i got a lot of good ideas trouble is most of them suck i got a lot of good ideas for new products like that thats what i think about on my off duty hours things we need products we ought to have that we dont have you know what we ought to have we ought to have a diet salad dressing called  islands see good god damn ideas like that huh a christian deodorant thou shalt not smell how about a feminine hygiene spray called sprunt huh well youd never forget the name would you it would always be on the tip of your tongue see marketing marketing thats where i belong among other places marketing heres an idea i got this is a yoyo with a  string you use it when you visit the grand canyon see im a visionary im ahead of my time trouble is im only about an hour and a half ahead heres a good idea a light bulb that only shines on things worth looking at yeah kind of too idealistic never make any money on a thing like that heres something thats going to make you a fortune get in on this this is a roach spray it doesnt kill the roaches but it fills them with selfdoubt as to whether or not theyre in the right house yeah heres something im trying to interest the japanese electronics firms in this this would be a great product for sony this is a combination cassette player and colostomy bag its called shitman huh sure well you never see that you never see that you never see a guy jogging down the street listening to a shitman no thats one of those things you never see theres a lot of things you never see and you dont know you dont see them because you dont see them you got to see something first to

time for life people im brain dead here you people got no respect for the brain dead hey you got to be brain dead to watch geraldo in the first place you might as well watch him when youre clinically brain dead theres one other thing i thought about concerning this comatose thing and this might help you someday this little piece of information might come in handy sometime in the future if youre in this circumstance if you knew a family if you knew a family and one of them was a homosexual and he was in an automobile accident and he was comatose you could always comfort that family by saying well look at it this way he was a fruit now hes a vegetable listen at least hes still in the produce sectionnow i probably got some other group pissed off at me because i said fruit theres a different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything youre not supposed to say cant say fruit cant say faggot cant say queer cant say nancy boy cant say pansy cant say ngger boogie jig jiggaboo skinhead jungle bunny moolie moolie yan or schwarz cant say yid heeb zeeb kike mackie dego ginny wop ginzo greaser greaseball spick beaner oya tiger pr mick donkey turkey limey frog squarehead kraut jerry hun chink jap nip slope slopehead zip zipper head gook there is absolutely nothing wrong\\u2026 there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves theyre only words its the context that counts its the user its the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad the words are completely neutral the words are innocent i get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language bullshit its the context that makes them good or bad the context that makes them good or bad for instance you take the word ngger there is absolutely nothing wrong with the word ngger in and of itself its the racist asshole thats using it that you ought to be concerned about we dont care when richard pryor or eddie murphy says it why because we know theyre not racists theyre nggers context context we dont mind their context because we know theyre black hey i know im whitey the blueeyed devil patio fake gray boy honkie motherfucker myself dont bother my ass theyre only words you cant be afraid of words that speak the truth even if its an unpleasant truth like the fact that theres a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country i dont like words that hide the truth i dont like words that conceal reality i dont like euphemisms or euphemistic language and american english is loaded with euphemisms because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality americans have trouble facing the truth so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it and it gets worse with every generation for some reason it just keeps getting worseill give you an example of that theres a condition in combat most people know about it its when a fighting persons nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum cant take any more input the nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap in the first world war that condition was called shell shock simple honest direct language two syllables shell shock almost sounds like the guns themselves that was  years ago then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue four syllables now it takes a little longer to say doesnt seem to hurt as much fatigue is a nicer word than shock shell shock battle fatigue then we had the war in korea in  madison avenue was riding high by that time and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion hey were up to eight syllables now and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase its totally sterile now operational exhaustion sounds like something that might happen to your car then of course came the war in viet nam which has only been over for about  or  years and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war i guess its no surprise that the very same condition was called posttraumatic stress disorder still eight syllables but weve added a hyphen and the pain is completely buried under jargon posttraumatic stress disorder i bet you if wed have still been calling it shell shock some of them viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time but it didnt happen and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language that language that takes the life out of lifeand it is a function of time it does keep getting worse give you another example sometime during my life sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue i wasnt notified of this no one asked me if i agreed with it it just happenedtoilet paper became bathroom tissue sneakers became running shoes false teeth became dental appliances medicine became medication information became directory assistance the dump became the landfill car crashes became automobile accidents partly cloudy became partly sunny motels became motor lodges house trailers became mobile homes used cars became previously owned transportation room service became guest room dining and constipation became occasional irregularity when i was a little kid if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional poor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities and theyre broke theyre broke they dont have a negative cash flow position theyre fucking broke because a lot of them were fired you know fired management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce smug greedy wellfed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins its as simple as that the cia doesnt kill anybody any more they neutralize people or they depopulate the area the government doesnt lie it engages in disinformation the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call sunshine units israeli murderers are called commandos arab commandos are called terrorists contra killers are called freedom fighters well if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part of it to us do they never mention that part of itsome of this stuff is just silly we all know that like on the airlines they say they want to pre board well what the hell is pre board what does that mean to get on before you get onthey say theyre going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance cripples simple honest direct language theres no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary no shame attached to it in fact its a word used in bible translations jesus healed the cripples doesnt take seven words to describe that condition but we dont have any cripples in this country any more we have the physically challenged is that a grotesque enough evasion for youhow about differently abled ive heard them called that differently abled you cant even call these people handicapped anymore theyll say were not handicapped were handy capable these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition somehow youll change the condition well hey cousin doesnt happen doesnt happenwe have no more deaf people in this country hearing impaired no ones blind any more partially sighted or visually impaired we have no more stupid people everybody has a learning disorder or hes minimally exceptional how would you like to be told that about your child hes minimally exceptional oh thank god for that psychologists actually have started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficitsits getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient and we have no more old people in this country no more old people we shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens isnt that a typically american  century phrase bloodless lifeless no pulse in one of them a senior citizen and ive accepted that one ive come to terms with it i know its here to stay well never get rid of it thats what theyre going to be called so ill relax on that but the one i do resist the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they say look at him dan hes  years young imagine the fear of aging that reveals to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone to have to use an antonym and fear of aging is natural its universal isnt it we all have that no one wants to get old no one wants to die but we do so we bullshit ourselves i started bullshitting myself when i got to my s soon as i was in my s id look in the mirror and id say well i guess im getting older older sounds a little better than old doesnt it sounds like it might even last a little longer bullshit im getting old and its okay because thanks to our fear of death in this country i wont have to die ill pass away or ill expire like a magazine subscription if it happens in the hospital theyll call it a terminal episode the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome and if its the result of malpractice theyll say it was a therapeutic misadventure im telling you some of this language makes me want to vomit well maybe not vomit makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spillthank you all give me a little light for moe moe says helloyour email address will not be published required fields are marked
