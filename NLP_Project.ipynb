              "' sometimes listed as on location george carlin at phoenixperformed at the celebrity star theater in phoenix on july   this is george carlin and i thought we might take a look at some of the pictures from the days when my show business career was just starting this is one of the earliest photos of my days as an actor here i’m playing the part of a baby in an early production of a play called “hold onto the rail” as proof of the intensity i brought to the role lying nearby you can see a doll that i had recently strangled this is a candid photo of my first manager and i having a business conference in the park where we knew we couldn’t be bugged in this photo i am trying out a new funny face that i had been working on for about six months now here i am with uh two of my fellow actors from the west harlem production of either ben hur or the sound of music you can’t really tell from what we’re wearing there because those are our street clothes and the person off to one side is our personal manager who insisted on being in all of our publicity photos this is a rare photo uh this is a photo of me in a singing group called the mills brothers uh we didn’t know that there was already a group in existence by that name the mills brothers sued us so we dropped two guys and changed the named to mickey and sylvia this is a picture of the time i came in second in a suntan contest the boy in the middle won but it was uh later he was disqualified when it was discovered he had been using pep pills uh this is the same photo with the negative reversed as you can see the suntans are approximately the same on the back this is me during an early suicide attempt i was despondent at that time because my puberty was coming along very slowly this one was taken during the nationwide search for a replacement for lassie i remember this picture i’m trying to get my dog spotty a fox terrier to stand up straight and act like a collie uh although he didn’t get the part later he did go on to become mars the cat god rest his soul’s manager this is a picture of me and the boy who doubled for me during my early film career normally i did all my own stunts except for the scenes involving homosexuality of course and this boy served that purpose this is me singing in a trio i had started which was called the inkspots oddly enough the naacp sued the trio and forced me to drop out when i couldn’t prove there was such a thing as flesh colored ink this is my first communion picture it was so well received that i decided to use it for publicity and to this day this is the picture that i send out when producers call and ask me if i’m interested in serious actingand that brings me to today here in phoenix arizona where we’re going to shoot one of these comedy shows for the first time in the round so i’ll see you around all right now i’m starting to feel it marty let’s go marty all right no i want to do like this is what guys who run do sprinters do this  dash i

lot of us got here you had to get in and drive the big iron thing trying real hard not to hit anyone else in the other big iron things but we got here now all we have to do is get back again i do think about the audience though i’m in the audience too you know i mean i feel like i’m in the audience i just happen to have the best seat in the house that’s all i am in the audience and i know the things you think of i think of them too when i’m driving to the theater going to be in the audience i’m thinking to myself what kind of a member of the audience will i be tonight will i be a credit to my row will we win row of the year suppose we get some shit from another section if there’s a fire drill will i file out safely or trample the shit out of my neighbor pardon me fire look out fire

not there do you wonder what it’s like when you’re not there anymore when you’re gone you know you were somewhere you were over here with your friends and you’re talking some shit with them you say we’ll see you later phil we’re going downtown and then you leave do you wonder what it’s like over there now i wonder are they gonna treat me right while i’m gone what’s it like i wonder a lot of things but that’s my job my job is thinking up goofy shit you know that’s my job thinking up goofy shit my job is to think up stuff and come around and remind you of it cause you already knew it you just forgot to laugh at it that’s all my job to remind you i wonder about things like i wonder if on a rainy night the sandman sends the mudman you’d think it would be his job i wonder why we don’t have any large craft warnings apparently we don’t care about the big boats huh i wonder why marineland doesn’t have a display of fish sticks i mean it’s a seafood i’d like to see it in fact i’d like

there are not waiters in waiting rooms they’re all in the restaurant i wonder why women wear evening gowns to nightclubs why don’t they wear nightgowns and i wonder why fluorescent lights seem afraid to come on have you ever noticed you turn them on and they go blip blip blip blip blip… finally they’ll come on after you coax them a little i wonder why kleenex doesn’t have a target in the middle of it don’t you think we need a bullseye right in the middle of the kleenex i wonder about hats did you ever notice that when you have a hat on for a long time it feels like it’s not there and then when you take it off it feels like it’s still there that’s creepy i wonder about frog’s legs in those restaurants where they serve frog’s legs what do they do with the rest of the frog what do they just throw it away i mean they don’t have frog torsos on the menu they must be doing something with them they throw them away can you imagine a barrel full of frog bodies in the restaurant and some drunk coming down the alley oh goddamn i wouldn’t wanna see that i wonder about who empties wishing wells who the hell empties the wishing wells that’s our money i’ve never seen an accounting does anybody ever tell you no gone just gone someone picked it up someone emptied the well i’m sure they don’t come around at  in the afternoon on sunday with a little girl in her first communion dress dropping a dime  in the morning black tshirts empty the wishing well it’s our money and i want some of it back i wonder if movie directors have credits on their dreams and i wonder why there’s no blue food where the hell is the blue food every other food is represented… i mean every other color every other color is represented i mean every color… okay red is raspberry cherry and strawberry orange is orange yellow is lemon green is lime brown is meat there’s no blue food why the hell was blue left out of the food thing somebody’s got the blue food goddammit somebody’s got it it probably bestows immortality that’s why we haven’t been given any and don’t say blueberries we know they’re purple you look at a blueberry and you see that sucker is purple bleu cheese no bleu cheese is just white cheese with a bunch of mold in it man and bluefish god knows you open one up they’re every color under the sun well enough of that shit i wonder i wonder which came first skilled workers or unskilled and who decided i figure originally all we had was workers and then they decided this is hard and they called themselves skilled and someone else came along they couldn’t do it poor unskilled son of a bitch they moved right past his ass man when he was just in the landing area do you think maybe charlie mccarthy has little wooden balls i’ve always wondered that hi charlie hi charlie you know what i wonder about i wonder we buy flowers why do we buy flowers they’re free they grow all over yet we buy them we pay good money for flowers flowers that are dying i might add that’s a little strange flowers is one flowers is one of the few things that you buy you bring it to your house and if they die you don’t give a shit normally you’d be asking for your money back on anything that died are you kidding me these things keeled over on the piano flowers i wonder why i’ve never seen anyone cleaning a church have you i’ve never seen someone cleaning a church a lot of things go on in church you never see a cleaning crew going in there with pails and mops and shit it just never happens why don’t they clean churches you know why churches don’t need to be cleaned they clean themselves overnight that’s how they know they’re churches come back the next morning shit it’s still clean must be a churchdoes the time bother you i get bothered by the time not so much the time itself the people bother me for the time people come up to me on the street i’m sure you’ve had this happen to you people come up to you and say what time it is or they might say what time is it i shouldn’t get into these ballads you’ve had people come up to you and say what time is it what time is it as if you personally were responsible for keeping time you know i feel i feel honored first of all that they thought i was the man in charge but i do have to explain you don’t see official timekeeper on here do you i don’t have the time of course not do you have the time that’s another way they say it do you have the time i say uh no i don’t believe i do i certainly didn’t have it this morning did you leave it somewhere well do you have the time no i don’t have the time i use a little of it like everyone you know but i don’t have it i think i think the navy has it in washington isn’t that they keep it in an observatory that’s right sure they let out a little of it each day not too much they wouldn’t want to give us too much just enough time sometimes they’ll say do you know what time it is and i say yes i hate to disappoint them but there is no time there is no time i don’t mean there’s no time i mean there’s no time when the hell is it we made that whole thing up there’s no time we made it up it’s a manmade invention time there are no numbers up in the sky i’ve looked they’re not there we made this stuff up when is it when the hell is it when are we i ask you when are we sometimes we think we know where we are but we don’t really know when we are when the hell is it all the time zones are different every calendar you run across is different they’ll all give you a different answer these are calendars these are made to… to keep track of time everybody’s got a different one the chinese are way up there in the  and ’s hebrew calendar is way up in the  and ’s we’re up at about  well shit this ain’t a couple of weeks these people are off this is thousands of goddamn years that are missing man how did they do that we don’t we don’t know when the hell is it it could be the middle of last month for all we know i mean time is so we’ve got it down so perfect that every four years we have to stick in an extra day just to make sure it still works and we call it february  bullshit it’s march  and i know it it just feels like march  you can’t keep track of the time what’s the sense give you an example there’s a moment coming it’s not here yet it’s still on the way it’s in the future it hasn’t arrived here it comes here it is oh shit it’s gone there’s no now there’s no now everything is the near future or the recent past but there’s no present welcome to the present whoosh gone again it’s just so imprecise we don’t even care to use the minutes and seconds and hours that we’ve been given everybody’s very vague about the time they say what time you got i got uh i got just after just after geez i must be slow i had going on and where did that imprecision begin why is it we’re not so sure i know one of the clues that happened to me was when they started telling me about moments when i was a kid they were trying to teach me how to tell time and of course you can’t tell time time tells you but they were trying they were trying to show me now the big hand i said i don’t have a big hand never mind look at the clock and the clock is so wonderful there’s so much emotion attached to a clock face i hate digital clocks digital clocks rob me of all the emotional experience of the spatial relationships on that face of the clock isn’t it true i mean don’t you always feel that this half hour when it comes down from  down to  goes by a lot quicker than this half hour when it has to come up fighting gravity all the way i know it does go a lot quicker yeah oh i got ya yeah i’ll tell ya i’ll tell ya this if i only have a half to live i want it to be this one man i wanna last just a little bit longer than this one here it’s vague that’s all i’m saying it’s very vague how we treat time we have all these wonderful expressions we say now now is an interesting one when now you want that now yes well would you like to try again or sometimes just now just now did you hear that what just now you must mean just then don’t you yes just then but there it goes again when – now – no not now pardon me do you have the time when do you mean now or when you asked me this shit is moving ruth we got a lot of these vague terms right away immediately at once lickety split just like that nothing flat drop of a hat no time at all as quick as you can say jack robinson i’m sure you’ve done that to people i’ll be back before you can say jack robinson jack robinson you’re not back how about a jiffy a jiffy or a flash which is quicker a jiffy or a flash i think there are two flashes in a jiffy myself but god knows how many jiffies there are in two shakes of a lamb’s tail and why did they use two shakes of a lamb’s tail what’s wrong with the basic unit of measurement one shake of a lamb’s tail we can do our own arithmetic thank you belched a little there tried to swallow that one then we have words like soon soon that’s a very emotional word there’s a lot of potential for drama in that word soon soon soon is your mother coming home uhhuh when soon real soon as soon as she can sooner than you think that’s kind of a spooky one sooner than i think that’s a little bit like before you know it i’ll be back before you know it he did it holy christ look at that and we go on with these terms that we use these vague terms of time one of these days before long any time now well that’s true everything is gonna happen any time now any day now that’s kind of a snotty one any day now hey i’ll be giving you that five bucks i owe you bill yeah any day now sooner or later now and then once in a while from time to time in a little while in a little while that will just be a little while that’s a wonderful one and i just love that it sounds so benign just a little while couldn’t hurt you could it you can wait a little while it’ll only be a little while longer just a little while that’s so different from a short time short time sounds sound almost terminal doesn’t it you only have a short time whereas you have a little while oh i’d rather have a little while than a short time you know we’ve got long ways we measure time we’ve got vast distances of time we measure people will say things like kingdom come i’m… i’m gonna be standing here till kingdom come shit i don’t have that on my watch doomsday you say doomsday till the cows come home now that’s an easy one to understand that’s long about dusk isn’t it if you leave them out overnight they’d burst here’s a long period of time forever some people will tell you gosh i’ve been standing on this line forever look at this dave this man has been standing on line forever he looks fairly fresh to me almost like an eternity people will tell you it’s… it’s almost like an eternity as if they had experience with eternities now you must have a favorite period of time i have some favorites i just want to try a few of them on you it isn’t easy uh to select a favorite period of time so many of them are attractive but there are little periods of time that um that you might relate to of course the most basic period of time i feel is five minutes that seems to be the one everyone chooses if they need to think of a period of time real quickly they just go five minutes just five minutes i’ll be there in just five minutes give me five minutes would you please just would you just give me five minutes are you kidding me i can fix that shit in five minutes five minutes that’s all most people want five minutes a good solid nice period of time you can do anything for five minutes can’t you i mean anything even things you really hate yeah you can probably do it for five minutes hey let’s go talk to ted are you kidding ted’s an asshole look just five minutes huh okay let’s give him five minutes not ten ten i can’t make now you’re getting into double digits you’re starting to fool with my head time five ten minutes fifteen minutes is popular you hear fifteen quite a bit but it’s it’s sort of an institutional one it’s kind of an official time period  minutes has a touch of regulatory uh quality to it doesn’t it it sounds like something you’re not supposed to do or have to do for  minutes fifteen minutes i like  minutes doesn’t that sound free compared to   minutes twenty minutes i’ll be back in  minutes gosh what’s he gonna dodo you have those news stories for me maybe

smoke he could not see and the dog led him out of the room down the hall and into an elevator shaft where he plunged eight stories to his deathi want to do a… a nostalgic thing here for my own sake and for the request of a couple of people that are on the crew that are listening or looking through viewers or listening on headsets or whatever and do a little uh weather forecast from al sleet al sleet the hippydippy weatherman hey baby what’s happening que pasa que what you call your pasa al sleet here your hippydippy weatherman with all the hippydippy weather man brought to you by parson’s pest control do you have termites waterbugs and roaches well parson’s will help you get rid of the termites and waterbugs and help you smoke the roaches hey temperature at the airport is  degrees which is stupid man cause i don’t know anybody who lives at the airport now if you’ll take a look at our national weather map you’ll see that we don’t have one so try to picture last night’s map in your mind remember all the letters and lines all them little numbers the weather is dominated by a large canadian low which is not to be confused with a mexican high tonight’s forecast dark continued dark tonight turning to partly light in the morning old al al got out of the weather business and he’s uh he’s now a a linoleum uh quality control inspector in a linoleum plant al he only wanted to get out of the media you know he said fuck it i don’t need it and uh hey who can blame him i don’t know but al got out of weather when he realized he had given the… the final weather forecast he had given the ultimate forecast there was nowhere to go you know when there’s nothing left to conquer in your field hey it’s time to leave and old al had given the ultimate forecast he told us he said one night that the weather will continue to change on and off for a long long time then he was gone from it god bless alokay yes you’re all you’re all going to die didn’t mean to remind you of it but it is on your schedule yes it probably won’t happen when you want it usually comes along when you’re not expecting generally you have your stamp collection out you know now now just want a little time to put away your hinges you know no there’s a time to die and it’s okay you know it’s really okay nobody wants to die nobody well you know ha ha most people don’t wanna die nobody wants to die boy if you think being sick is no fun dying is really a pain in the ass nobody wants to die people don’t mind being dead being dead is great but getting dead nobody wants to get dead so i hope i don’t die i wonder how often we think that you know it’s just under the surface isn’t it you go out for the day going out of your house geez i hope i don’t die it would really spoil the circus if i were to die geez i hope i don’t die comedians don’t wanna die it’s only a metaphor but it’s true of all of us we don’t wanna die out there a comic’s gonna die i don’t want to die geez i was dying out there i was dying it was death out there it was like a morgue i don’t wanna die of course if the comedian doesn’t die you know if he succeeds if he makes you laugh then he can say i killed ’em i killed ’em so it’s either me or you you know just like on the freeway yeah dying shouldn’t be that bad it shouldn’t be that bad we’re all gonna do it it’s one of the few fair things in life everybody catches it once and dying should be fun there should be some sort of a look ahead i mean after all when you die you’re gonna find out where you go haven’t we been wondering about that a long time where the hell we go isn’t that the biggest thing we have to wonder about where the hell do you go i don’t know joe thinks he knows i know joe thinks he knows but joe don’t know where do we go nobody knows well i think sometimes you go where you think you’re gonna go whatever you think you’re gonna do that’s where you’re probably gonna go if you keep saying you’re gonna go somewhere chances are you might go there you ever hear those guys say i’m going to hell don’t pray for me don’t pray for me i’m going to hell he is you go where you wanna go i think when you die your soul goes to a garage in buffalo when monte hall dies he’ll go behind door number  that’s it where you wanna go no nobody wants to die and you know part of the reason we don’t wanna die is because of that goddamn funeral we’ve seen it we know how bad news it is that funeral is no fun man if i don’t like other people’s funerals i know i’m not gonna like my own man there’s no way i can get behind my own funeral gonna be lying there in a casket they’re gonna put me in the box gonna put me in a convertible with the top down you know that’s embarrassing lying there and everybody’s looking at you you’re dead and they’re looking you’re just lying there still people coming over going… they don’t know that you’re lying there with short pants on and no back in your jacket embarrassing and sometimes they’ll come over you know some people it depends on your religion and so forth but they do come right over to the casket a lot of times and they’ll go like this and they’re silent for a moment and what they’re doing while they’re silent is they’re subtracting their age from your age so they get a rough estimate on what they have left and they get up and they say don’t he look good don’t he look good you crazy he’s dead i know but he never looked that good well they say the nicest things about you they say the nicest things when you die your popularity goes straight up when you die they say the greatest things there are that can be said they’ll even make stuff up if they have to well he was a real asshole but he meant well you know he was a wellmeaning asshole yes you get so popular when you die all the flowers you get think of the flowers you get when you die you get more flowers when you die than you got in your whole life all your flowers arrive at once too late and guys will say oh yeah well you know bill is dead yeah poor bill poor bill is dead yeah poor dave yeah poor dave is gone now ed yeah poor ed is gone dan that motherfucker is still alive isn’t he i wish he would die so i could like him reincarnation is another aspect of death that a lot of people will tell you little tales about it reincarnation coming back a lot of folks are sure of it they can come back you come back as something i don’t know does it seem right to you that it would work i mean mathematically it doesn’t seem to work because originally on this earth we only had well let’s say six people i know we had two but it’s a controversial number let’s say at one time there were only there were only six of us about six people six souls and those six people died and those souls went back to the staging area and new people were born and those six souls came back we still only have six souls now we have four billion people claiming to have souls where are all these extra souls coming from someone is printing up souls and it lowers their value the more souls there are the less they’re worth it would seem well somebody’s got to think of this shit you know how about the perfect murder i’ve thought sometimes about the perfect murder you know what you do you pick up one person by the ankles and you beat another person to death with him and they both die and there’s no murder weapon hey what happened here sergeant looks like a pedestrian accident to me they must have been moving at quite a clip of course if you should be caught with this perfect murder in progress or even after the fact if you should be caught you might wind up on death row death row wow that’s more than just fun ain’t it i mean there’s cats there death row man shit oh well you got that one meal but that’s not much of a consolation is it you’re gonna get to order your meal big deal why don’t you leave me alone i’m not hungry man they give you that one last meal i say you can have some fun with that last meal i mean if you work it right they gotta give you whatever you want i mean short of elephant steak you know they don’t wanna start on a new elephant just for one guy but they gotta give you pretty much what you want that’s part of the humanity of what they’re going to do to you yeah you could just order something you know like maybe well shit you tell them you can’t decide that’s it i can’t decide i don’t know i don’t know if i want steak or lobster you know i mean i really love them both and i honestly can’t decide could they kill you i don’t think they could kill you if you honestly couldn’t decide lie detector truth serum the man honestly doesn’t know what he wants we can’t very well kill him we can’t drag him down the last mile screaming i don’t know what i want you gotta give him a chance and then he… well man lives imagine if you worked it out and you kept it going six months man is still alive can’t decide on meal three years eight years and then finally you’re an honest person so you tell them when you do figure it out and you say i’ve decided what i’d like i think i’ll have steak okay how did you want that oh well my feeling is if you’re gonna die you know or if you know hey die big die big nobody wants to just pass away you don’t want to be a euphemism do you nobody wants to pass away you know arnie passed away oh really yes well i didn’t know that well that’s the idea on the other hand dave died oh yes i heard about dave dying that’s true i say die big give it a shot man go out big it’s your chance die big work in a few posthumous reflexes for your friends give them a show before you go entertain and uplift and instruct those you are leaving behind when you die give them a few posthumous reflexes you know the body does store electricity up there’s a certain storage of electricity and even a dead body a corpse will occasionally go sound and i say if you have that potential after you’re dead use it properly preprogram before you die preprogram some posthumous reflexes that will be entertaining to those you’ve left behind do something to capture their imagination roll over on the autopsy table that’s nice cross your legs scratch your balls do something now the only reason the only reason that i even suggest that you have a choice about what you can do at the moment of death is a very little known and very little understood part of the death process called the twominute warning many people are not aware of it at all the twominute warning just as in football two minutes before you die you receive an audible warning two minutes get your shit together the reason we don’t know about it is because the only people who hear it die and i don’t think we’d believe someone anyway if he told us he’d received his twominute warning would you some asshole on the bus hey i just got my twominute warning you’d think it was a coach out on the town you know but no the twominute warning does arrive and i say use that time to entertain to leave something behind do something with the two minutes hey if nothing else give a speech a little twominute speech we can all give a little twominute speech just pick some subject you’re very fond of and talk about it for two minutes i mean tell them it’s your last chance to tell them anything so tell them you got two minutes and i mean wax eloquent rise bring it to the rafters and then at the moment of the end you say if this is not the truth may god strike me deadwell that leads me into the filth and uh to kind of wind up thank you you know that’s the trouble with it is trying to decide what to call these words man i’m trying to decide what to call this whole thing you know what are these words that i’m talkin about they’re just words that we’ve decided sort of decided not to use all the time that’s about the only thing you could really say about them for sure that they’re just some words not many either just a few that we’ve decided well we won’t use them all the time sometimes well hell yeah sometimes it’s okay but not all the time and they’re the only words that seem to have that restriction i mean there are a lot of words you can say whenever you want you know pneumonia nobody gives you a lot of… all right you can’t yell it in the hospital a great deal but what the hell there are words that you can say no problem topography no one has ever gone to jail for screaming topography but there are some words that you can go to jail for there are some words that we just have decided we will not say all the time sometimes okay if you’re running through the jungle chasing somebody that we’re at war with you can holler them if you’re shooting a criminal it’s okay it’s the all american thing dirty fucking crook but if you’re with the bishop’s wife at lunch it’s better not to ask for the goddamn lettuce you know what i mean it’s just like we’ve decided there’d be some words we won’t say all the time and i was just trying to find out which words they were for sure all of them i wanted a list cause nobody gives you a list that’s the problem they don’t give you a list wouldn’t you think it would be normal if they didn’t want you to say something to tell you what it is nobody even tells you when you’re a kid what the words are that you’re supposed to avoid you have to say them to find out which ones they are shit ahhhh oh fuck ahhhh that’s two oh ma that’s enough trial and error huh please ma give me a list huh all right you’re six years old now and here’s the list of words your dad and i don’t ever want to hear you say oh hey thanks ma boy that’s gonna save me an ass kicking or two ahhhh ohhh yeah you never know what’s gonna be on the list cause it’s always somebody else’s list you didn’t make that up somebody told you that shit they told you better… better not say that so you’re gonna… and you don’t know what’s gonna be on their list god people’s lists even change from day to day some people on friday night got a list you know about two or three words sunday morning goddamn there’s  words on it these are the same people two days later different list so you’ve gotta kind of watch out what you’re gonna believe from them the trouble is i was trying to find out what these words might be and i wanted to know the ones that you could never say on television i mean the filthy words that are always filthy there are a lot of these little twoway double entendre words that have two meanings words that they’re okay part of the time i call them like parttime filth some of these words they’re only  percent dirty you have words like ass ass is hardly even a dirty word anymore but it has a few meanings that you can’t say on television that’s what i was talking about what can you say on television that’s another one of those places where we can’t use these words all the time but some of them are all right some of the time ass is all right on television you can say on television things like well you’ve made a perfect ass of yourself tonight but you can’t say hey let’s go get some ass bitch bitch is another word like that same kind of word it’s only dirty part of the time depends on what you mean by bitch you might be the lady from the san diego zoo visiting one of the tonight shows and you might just have a bunch of little canines with you there one of them is a female and you say there’s the bitch johnny and it’s okay fine just don’t refer to the singer the same way that’s all is that bitch gonna do another number yes animals are fine on those twoway words and that’s it that’s what i was trying to find the words that were always dirty not just part of the time but completely filth well in… in looking for these words i kept finding new categories we have so many ways of describing these dirty words it’s well we have more ways to describe dirty words than we actually have dirty words that seems a little strange to me it seems to indicate that somebody was awfully interested in these words they kept referring to them they called them bad words dirty filthy foul vile vulgar coarse in poor taste unseemly street talk gutter talk locker room language barracks talk bawdy naughty saucy raunchy rude crude lewd lascivious indecent profane obscene blue offcolor risque suggestive cursing cussing swearing and all i could think of was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits man that’s all we have shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits that was my original list i knew it wasn’t complete but it was a starter set you know …mention wbai shit piss fuck… yes wbai is the one who played them… shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits now that was the original list we’ve added a few words since then we’ve added fart turd and twat and i know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about why they haven’t been considered why they haven’t shown up on the list thus far we’re looking at them all very closely some of your favorites might make the list this year asshole ballbag hard on piss hard blue balls… nookie snatch box pussy pecker peckerhead peckertracks jism joint donicker dork poontang cornhole and dingleberry dingleberry a very popular word and to my way of thinking dingleberry a rather innocent sounding word dingleberry sounds christmasy to me you know let’s put one on the tree dad so the words as i say shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat now motherfucker came off the list immediately the first day in fact i had a call from an english language purist some guy had to he had to talk you know he got on the phone he tells me i have a duplicate on the list i have a duplication he says motherfucker is a duplication of the word fuck technically because fuck is the root form motherfucker being a derivative therefore it constitutes duplication and i said hey motherfucker how did you get my phone number anyway how did he know i even had a phone i said look man it may be a derivative but you still can’t say it you still can’t say motherfucker on tv can you he said no but you can’t say fuckee fucking fuckola fuckarooni or fuckarino either well i said yeah that would crowd up my list something awful so i just struck that motherfucker away i struck it from the list motherfucker was gone now the list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits does is sound like something’s missing does it sound like an old friend is gone shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits remember the old rhythm shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits now shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits it falls apart it isn’t going anywhere and by now cocksucker is the dominant word on the list previously with motherfucker on the list cocksucker was somewhat balanced out they were the only multisyllabic words on the list but now cocksucker stands alone shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits and who knows maybe it doesn’t belong either after all motherfucker turned out to be a ringer let’s take a look at cocksucker see if this one belongs we’ll divide the word cock and sucker from each other those words sucker isn’t dirty sucker it’s suggestive as hell but it isn’t dirty and cock that’s not dirty all the time that’s one of those words that’s only partly filthy cock if you’re talking about the animal it’s perfectly all right they used to read that to us from the bible in third grade and we would laugh man cock is in the bible remember the first time you heard about a cock fight what no get out of here get out of here even the word cocksucker itself has been twisted out of all of its original meaning it’s been distorted for some reason now cocksucker means bad man it’s a good woman how did they do that how did they do that well tits is on the end of the list shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and you know it doesn’t belong on that list i mean it really doesn’t belong in with that kind of heavyweight filth tits isn’t dirty tits is a cute name cute thing cute idea great fun good name tits hey tits sounds like a friend it sounds like a nickname doesn’t it hey tits come here man hey tits i want you to meet toots tits this is toots toots tits tits cute word nice word i love a word that spells the same forwards and backwards like tit don’t you think it’s cute when a word is spelled the same forwards and backwards i always wished my name was otto just so i could walk backwards and yell my name you know otto otto otto well i had strange dreams but the word tit is on the list because you can’t say it on television you can’t say tit imagine that can’t say tits you can say boobs boob is spelled the same forwards and backwards too boobs is all right you can’t say tits but you can say boobs in fact boobs is an answer now on match game i had boobs gene boobs  tits  fine maybe you can’t say tits you can say teats teats is all right providing you’re on at  in the morning and a cow is your guest but you can’t say jugs and you can’t say knockers you know that’s right danny pull on the cow’s knockers right grab a knocker in each hand that a boy now alternate knockers good deal you can’t say that tits tits sounds like a snack you know well i know what you’re thinking but tits sounds almost it sounds nabisco to me it sounds like nabisco has… has reserved that name cause tits sounds like a thing at a party pass the tits would you bill say those things are… responding well shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat fart fart is like tit it’s one of those words that isn’t that harmful you know it’s just a cute kind of a thing farts well farts can be a little harmful it depends it depends on who’s cooking but fart fart is a cute… hey kids know farts are okay kids know farts are fun farts are shit without the mess wow yeah same funny sound same vile smell no fuss no muss fart is an interesting word in this respect talking about television fart is extremely interesting because dig this you can’t say fart on television we know that you can’t say fart and you can’t say fuck either on television however you can refer to fucking you can talk about fucking they do that all the time some of the times in the show you’re watching two people are probably fucking in the other room fucking is all right fucking is part of the plot a lot of plots are based on fucking will they fuck should they fuck have they fucked did they fuck will they fuck again will they get sick from fucking are they fucking too much will they fuck each other’s friends will they have a baby from fucking will they be sorry they fucked will they be glad they fucked all fuck stories every honeymoon joke is a fuck joke have you ever noticed it otherwise the people wouldn’t be on their honeymoon in the joke they’d be knights or they’d sailors or something they’re on their honeymoon it’s got to be a fuck joke every little every news… i’m sorry… every quiz master has stood there with his newlywed couple and said and i understand you folks are on your honeymoon lots of fucking going on here lots of fucking over here so they talk about fucking all they want they just don’t call it that they don’t call it what it is they call it other things they call it making love which is fine they call it going to bed with someone having an affair sleeping together but they don’t call it fucking on the other hand fart not only is fart a word you can’t use on television but they never even refer to them that’s how bad farts are compared to fucking they don’t even refer to farts there are no farts on television you’ve never seen a reference to a fart i’ve never seen a fart reference no wouldn’t you think that by now one guy would have gone whew whew do you think by now that one guy on the johnny carson panel just once would have said hey ed move down man whew wow that was a clydesdale fart ed give me the lighter will ya johnny wow geez ed next time you’re sick you ought to see the nurse you know god it’s not the smell so much it’s the burning of my eyes well we might live to see that you never know remember when you were a kid and maybe you were a little boy child like me you had on short pants maybe sitting in church sitting on a wooden bench in church in the middle of the summer with short pants you gotta fart you know and it’s up to you you gotta work out a little maneuver that’s called the one cheek sneak right in tune with the organ that’s why they call them pews you know whew whew whew did you ever notice that your own farts smell okay say that’s fairly decent i think i’ll stay home today do some reading in the closet now i mentioned the three extra words fart turd and twat turd is another word you can’t say on television turd but you know when you get right down to it who wants to say it i don’t even care if i ever hear that one again twat twat is on the list for the same reason it doesn’t mean anything else you know it only has that one meaning twat’s twat and that’s that it’s not like prick prick is one of those parttime dirty words prick is all right you can say prick on television you can say i pricked my finger just don’t say you fingered your prick that’s all now there are two words left which i will wind this thing up with one of them is not uh dirty all the time one of them is ball or balls is a word that’s mostly clean it has many clean meanings but… but it has a couple of meanings that might get you in trouble and ball is one of those words you gotta think about how you’re gonna say it and maybe you have to watch out for just a moment but it’s okay for sports people perfectly all right when you’re a kid you grow up they tell ya go play with your ball really but it’s okay for the sports announcer on the game of the week to tell you that pete rose has two balls on him no problem at all the whole country nods in agreement but the announcer can’t tell you that he hurt his balls he can’t tell tony kubeck tony i think he hurt his balls on that play it looks like it he’s holding onto them well that’s right generally when they hurt their balls they hold them and he’s holding his and i’d say he’s hurt them never mention ball injuries they don’t say the balls were hurt they say groin injuries he had a groin injury do you know why we call it a groin injury that’s the noise you make when you get hit there groin now then the other word i wanted to remind you of was the word fuck which of course is the champ of the alltime dirty words when they’re always dirty by god fuck is right at the head of the pack fuck’s a good strong word it’s a good strong word for its purpose and it’s a word that a lot of people have trouble with uh it’s a… it’s an honest word it’s a… it’s a forceful word it has a lot of emotional baggage with it when you hear the word fuck you’re not just hearing the word you’re hearing everything you ever heard about fucking i mean we have a lot of attitudes about fucking some of them are rationale and some of them aren’t some of them have joy in them some have guilt and fear and all sorts of things and the word fuck carries with it a lot of emotional baggage when they say fuck you go what oh oh good oh i thought you meant do it right away god you know it’s uh it’s just a word that that well it’ll clear the room awfully quick in some households it’s a heavy good strong word it’s a proud sounding word to me fuck fuck i am fuck who are you fuck of the mountain i just uh i just feel the word is getting a bad shake the word has an image problem the word fuck needs public relations help it’s just a word you know that’s what you have to remember it’s just a word but it’s in such bad shape here’s a word that started out okay it started out all right nothing wrong with the word fuck originally i mean there it was you’re not a bad word you’re not a bad word you’ve just gotten in with bad company people that’s all just the word was all it was the word in the original old english as best i can find fuck only meant to hit to smite to… to perhaps hit with a stick to fuck the tree to fuck the rock to fuck thee that’s all and pretty soon that’s all i’ll hit you with my dick honey look at that that’s all it was just a little i’ll knock a little fuck on you there that’s all it was was a love tap when you get right down to it that’s all fuck ever meant all fuck ever meant was to make love and to make life at the same time that’s pretty magic i mean pretty noble things we think about making love and making life here was fuck hanging around with words like love and life how did it get such a bad reputation we fucked it up yeah well we… we put the aggression back into the word fuck you fuck you you fuck fuck you you fuck who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with some kind of a fuckhead fuck you who the fuck do you think you’re fucking with me don’t fuck with me i’ll fuck over you you fuck with me and you’ll get fucked you fuck don’t fuck with me i’m the fucker don’t fuck with the fucker god it sounds like combat man it’s got an awful lot there’s an awful lot of hostility in the way that word is used there’s an awful lot of aggression going down in the name of fucking imagine that i’d just like to help a little my feeling was hey here’s a word that uh maybe we could save you know just by paying a little close attention to it the trouble is with all that aggression and all that violence that we lose track of those two things and people start talking about sex and violence like they’re one thing there’s some sort of an overlapping there’s some sort of a gray area between sex and violence that some people really are confused about there are people running around talking about sex and violence as if it’s one thing as if it starts with an s and ends with a e we’re gonna stamp it out of the comics we’re gonna stamp it out of the dixie cup we’re gonna stamp it out of homes sex and violence hey they are different after all and some people even like them together there are true people who do like a little violence with their sex i’m not… i don’t care for that myself i like my violence a little earlier in the afternoon you know right around  o’clock a real good ass kicking and then everything’s all right but uh the word make love not war someone pointed it out finally they made it very clear for us make love not war i wish i had thought of that phrase you know i really would have been very happy with myself if i had thought of that one man i would have retired the same day i would have left my car at the red light man i’d say that’s it folks i’m going to the beach you got it make love not war well i didn’t think of it but i do have my own phrase make fuck not kill it’s not as graceful a phrase but i’m not looking to retire either the whole idea of make fuck not kill is simply to switch the meanings of the words i suggest that for one year we trade meanings on fuck and kill just fuck for kill and kill for fuck that’s it don’t worry about what they really are someone else will take care of real fucking and real killing i’m just worried about what we call it… them we call them fucking and killing i say switch them around i think it would be an insight i think we’d get a new slant on how we feel about these words if we just change fucking for killing for about a year that’s all imagine it sure would be fun watching tv during that time huh better get down off the horse sheriff we’re fixing to fuck you now mad fucker still on the loose not anymore he’s made his first big mistake my friend he fucked a cop today that makes him a cop fucker pardon me boys my horse broke his leg i’m gonna have to fuck him i’ll be right back shamu the fucker whale and to fuck a mockingbird hold gently by the wings so all i’m trying to suggest is that fuck you can be a positive phrase if you hear it from across the street… fuck you okayand thank you for being a part of this and i mean it a lot and i thank the people that aren’t here tonight that were here the other two nights and there’s an awful lot of people to thank but i want to do one thing before i go any

evening everybody hello there thank you thanks a lothave you noticed that most of the women who are against abortion are women that you wouldnt want to fuck in the first placethank you very much ladies and gentlemen good evening my name is george carlin and i am a professional comedian as opposed to the kind you run into at work all day long its nice being a comedian there are uh certain advantages naturally and a few disadvantages there are some drawbacks to being a comedian no one on death row has ever said before i die i wanna talk to a comedian you ever hear anyone at the scene of an accident say quick call a comedian for god sakes but it would be kind of fun at an accident to push your way through the crowd and say may i be of help im a professional comedian and sooner or later at least once in your life when the policeman says to you what are you a comedian youve gotta look him right in the eye and say actually yes even criminals have no respect for comedians what do they say first thing they do when they hold you up dont try anything funny first one makes a funny move gets it whenever theyre not looking i go well thats my job thinking up goofy shit thinking up goofy shit coming around every now and then letting you know what it is or reminding you of things you already know but forgot to laugh at the first time they happened we all have things like that you hear it during the day and then you dont remember it at all for instance ive noticed they have disposable douche and im wondering who would want to keep it in the first placei do have a lot some not a lot but i have some notes over here and uh the reason for that is i havent been doing this lately i want to make sure i know and remember everything tonight ive been taking a little time off six months i think i took uh three of them uh quite voluntarily and the other three quite against my will i had a heart attack or as they say in boston i had a heart attack he had a heart attack you hear about george he had a goddamn myocardial infarction i had a heart attack fortunately my pharmacist my cardiologist and my doctor give me cpr but i would like to bring you up to date uh on the comedians health sweepstakes as it stands right now i lead richard prior in heart attacks two to one i am ahead i am ahead thats right now however richard still leads me one to nothing on burning yourself up well the way it happened was first richard had a heart attack then i had a heart attack then richard burned himself up then i said fuck that im gonna have another heart attacki had an interesting morning got into an argument\\u2026 got into an argument with my rice krispies i distinctly heard snap crackle fuck him i dont know which one of them said it i was reaching for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl but i told them i said well you can all just sit right there in the milk far as im concerned you can sit in the milk until i find out which one of you said that a little mass punishment for my breakfast food the idea is to turn them against one another just sit in the milk far as im concerned silly me big punishment thats what they do anyway sit in the milk thats their job thats rice krispies job sitting in the milk youve seen them havent you floating along little beige blisters of air riding proudly in the milk but you cant sink them they float for a long time and you know why they stay together they gather together in little groups little groups of eight ten twelve sometimes fourteen but always an even number if youve noticed its the polarity of the krispies that attracts them they form little colonies of rice krispies but you cant sink them you try to sink them with a spoon they come up over the sides you cant sink them thats what the fruit is for sinking the rice krispies good size peach will take down  or  of them if im really pissed ill drop a watermelon on thembut i say interesting about my morning cause it was its not\\u2026 i dont have a nice day anymore i dont bother much with that i think im beyond that now i think ive outgrown the nice day i think ive had my share why should i be hogging all the really nice ones let somebody else have a few of course everybody still wants me to have one everybody wants me to have a nice day have a nice day yeah yeah yeah wanna give me my fucking change please im triple parked some of them are really insistent i said have a nice day all right all right goddammit all right ill give it a shot thats the trouble with have a nice day it puts all the pressure on you now youve gotta go out and somehow manage to have a good time all because of some looselipped cashier have a nice day maybe i dont feel like having a nice day maybe just maybe ive had  nice days in a row and im ready by god for a crappy day i never hear that let them wish one of them hey have a crappy day thank you and to your wonderful family as well a crappy day hey that would be easy its no trouble at all a crappy day just get up theres no planning involved for a crappy dayi know what it is that bothers me about that whole thing its the word nice its just a weak word

mouse with gloves and a parka on you know just\\u2026 just waiting for the lights to go out so he can get back to work i guess the worst thing that can happen cleaning out or looking through the refrigerator is to come across\\u2026 something\\u2026 that you cannot identify\\u2026 at all you literally do not know what it is it could be meat it could be cake usually at a time like that ill

people dont know that they say hitler geez he had a lot of balls\\u2026 onefor some time i was trying to get a list of words together that would fairly represent the dirty words cause nobody gives you a list of dirty words for life have you noticed that theres some words that are perfectly clean but sound like they could be filthy if you gave them just a little help a word like pussyfoot its perfectly clean but when you say pussyfoot theres a little giggle cause people know that with a little help this word could be filthy no matter what form of the verb you try its clean as a verb but pussyfoot could be a noun it could be a noun pussyfoot a rare disorder a female birth defect hello boys i have pussyfoot god you sure do lady and i love them opentoed shoes you have on well id rather have pussyfoot than woodpecker i can say thator beer nuts god that must be awful beer nuts the official disease of milwaukee i know whenever i see the little canister behind the bar i drop in a couple of dollars for beer nuts i think we need a lot more research on beer nuts or cotton balls which is the dreaded final stage of beer nuts when my beer nuts turn to cotton balls ill be heading home to you its an old southern hymnlots of little phrases like that in the language that dont quite say what they mean take a shit is another one take a shit you dont take shit you leave a shit thats the whole idea to leave it i left a shit fine thank you jeff whered you leave it in the icebox im gonna take a shit dont take one of mine i only have two left and the weekend is coming up why dont you go home and take one of your own shits guys always mooching off me he must think im made of shit or something boy that shit dont grow on trees you know well enough of that shit lots of little phrases like thatpick your nose is well blow your nose blow your nose is a phrase imagine that blowing your nose i dont believe they really mean that do you you cant blow your nose i believe its physically impossible to blow your nose you might get somebody else to blow your nose but it would have to be a real good friendcocktails another clean word you can advertise them you can put up signs all over town cocktails as long as you use both halves of the word perfectly fine but you cant advertise either one of those two items if you break those words in half theyll come and take your sign down cocktail its okay it depends on how you say that kind of word you ladies like some cocktails hey lady you want a cocktailcockpit men will actually laugh about that cockpit get it oh yeahbangkok theres a lovely city how would you like to be a hooker in bangkok it would seem like a natural habitatpeacock nbc is really proud of their peacock you know what a female peacock is a peacuntmy list i was just trying to isolate the words that were always filthy not the ones that were sometimes dirty and the original list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits this was all i could think of in one sitting just one try but we had to add some we had shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and then we added fart turd and twat which also dont have other meanings you know twats twat and thats that but after a while it didnt take long well it took quite a while but i finally discovered that there are only two words on the list you really had to deal with to sort of look at the double standard that television uses where language is concerned uh the two words were fart and fuck those are the only two they seem similar because you cant say either one of them you cant say fart and you cant say fuck no matter how cleverly you try to work them in no matter how clinical the conversation is fart and fuck will not show up on the final tape you simply cannot say them but thats where the similarity ends cause at least with the word fuck even though you cant say the word fuck you can talk about fucking oh you can refer to fucking theres lots of fuck talk going on on tv they just dont call it fucking thats the secret they dont use that word theres plenty of fuck talk you see people who wrote a book about fucking youll see a guy on a talk show who wrote a book about fucking how to fuck who to fuck when to fuck why to fuck and how to feel after you fuck this man is a fuck expert and he wrote a fuck book and hes talking to merv griffin about fucking and theyre getting away with it cause they dont call it fucking same with the soap operas everybody you take a look at a soap opera and you know everybody is fucking somebody on a soap opera and if theyre not fucking somebody theyre trying to fuck somebody will he fuck her did he fuck her has he fucked her should he fuck her can he fuck her some more will they fuck too much will they get silly from fucking who is fucking who thats all you want to know is what the fuck is going on on this program here you know that somebody is getting fucked and you think its you so theres lots of fuck talk and theres plenty of fucking on television they just dont call it fucking they call it everything elsenow on the other hand farts not only can you not mention the word fart but you cant refer to farts at all thats how bad farts are theyre worse than fucking you never hear anybody talking about farts on tv youve never seen a guy who wrote a book on farts how to fart who to fart at how to feel after you fart theres no fart experts on the merv griffin show you dont see any farts or fart references its a fart free zone wouldnt you think after  years one guy by now would have gone whew just once just once id like to see someone on the johnny carson panel say hey ed move down man that was a clydesdale fartwell anyway uh after a while i realized that i was needlessly restricting myself to seven words and only to the ones that werent allowed on tv i mean there were a lot more to be looked at and television isnt the only place that objects to your language sometimes there are lots of situations where youre not supposed to say that so i expanded the list by as many as i could and id like to share some with you now this list is a little longer than it was before first we start with the ones we already know shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat crap balls prick asshole jackoff jerkoff scumbag douche bag hardon rodon boner stiff piss hard blue balls

few licks on this totally bogus topic before it completely disappears from everyones consciencesfirst i want to be really clear about one thing as far as other peoples feeling are concerned\\u2014especially these victim groups\\u2014when i deal with them as individuals i will call them whatever they want when its one on one if some guy wants me to call him a morbidly obese africanancestored male with a same gendered sexual orientation ill be glad to do that one the other hand if he wants me to call him a fat ngger  than thats what it will be im here to pleaseif i meet a woman who wishes to be to be referred to as a motionimpaired same genderoriented italianamerican who is difficult to deal with fine on the other hand i am perfectly willing to call her a crippled guinea  cnt if she prefers im not trying to change anyones self image but but when i am speaking generally and impersonally about a large group of people i will call them what i think is honest and fair and i will not try and bullshit myselfokay so who exactly are these victims well first of all i dont think everyone who says he is a victim automatically qualifies i dont think a homely disfigured bald minority person with a room temperature iq who limps and stutters is necessarily always a victim although i will say that she probably shouldnt be out trying to get work as a receptionist but maybe thats just the way it oughtta beim more interested in the real victims people who have been fucked over by the system because the united states is a christian racist nation with a rigged economic system run for three hundred years by the least morally qualified of the two sexes there were bound to be some real victims people who have been elaborately fucked overthe way i see it this country has only four real victim groups indians blacks women and gays i purposely left out the spanish and asians because when you look at what happened to the indians and the blacks the spanish and asian people had a walk in the park its not even close not to downplay the shit theyve had to eat but in about one hundred years the spanish and asians are going to be running this country so theyll have plenty of chances to get even with the gray peoplelets get to some of these other nonvictims you probably noticed elsewhere i used the word fat i used that word because thats what fat people are theyre fat theyre not large theyre not stout chunky hefty or plump and theyre not bigboned dinosaurs are bigboned these people are not necessarily obese either obese is a medical term and theyre not overweight overweight implies there is some correct weight there is no correct weight heavy is also a misleading term an aircraft carrier is heavy it is not fat only people are fat thats what fat people are theyre fat i offer no apology for this it is not intended as criticism or insult it is simply descriptive language i dont like euphemisms euphemisms are a form of lying fat people are not gravitationally disadvantaged theyre fat i prefer seeing things the way they are not the way some people wish they werei dont believe groups deserve extraspecial names for instance midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they are not little people infants are little people leprechauns are little people  midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they dont get any taller by calling them little people i wish their lives were different i wish they didnt have to go around starring at other peoples crotches but i cant fix that and im not going to lie about what they are the politically sensitive commandos would probably like me to call them vertically challenged they are not vertically challenged a skydiver is vertically challenged the person who designed the empire state building was vertically challenged midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfsalso crippled people are crippled they are not differentlyabled if you insist on using such tortured language as differentlyabled then you must use it on all of us were all differentlyabled you can do things i cant do i can do things you cant do i can pick my nose with my thumb i can switch hands while masturbating and gain a stroke we are all differentlyabled crippled people are crippled its a perfectly honorable word there is no shame in it its in the bible jesus healed the cripples he didnt engage in rehabilitative strategies for the physically disadvantagedso leaving women and gays aside for a moment ive narrowed it down to blacks and indians lets talk about what we ought to call them and remember this has nothing to do with the people themselves it has to do with the wordsand by the way when it comes to liberal language vandals i must agree with there underlying premise white europeans and their descendants are morally unattractive people who are responsible for most of the worlds suffering that part is easy you would have to be uh visually impaired not to see it the impulse behind political correctness is a good one but like every good impulse in america it has to be grotesquely distorted beyond usefulnessclearly these are victims but i dont agree that these failed campus revolutionaries know what to do about them when theyre not busy curtailing freedom of speech theyre running around inventing absurd hyphenated names designed to make people feel better remember these are the white elitists in there customary paternalistic role protecting helpless inept minority victims  big daddy white boss always knows bestso let me tell you how i handle some of these speech issues first of all i say black i say black because most black people prefer black i dont say people of color people of color sounds like something you see when you are on mushrooms besides the use of people of color is dishonest it means precisely the same thing as colored people if youre not willing to say colored people you shouldnt be saying people of colorbesides the whole idea of color is bullshit anyway what should we call white people people of no color isnt pink a color in fact white people arent really white at all theyre different shades of pink olive and beige in other words theyre colored and black people are rarely black i see mostly different shades of brown and tan in fact some lightskinned black people are lighter than the darkest white people look how dark the people in india are theyre dark brown but theyre still considered white people whats going on here may i see the color chart people of color is an awkward bullshit  liberalguilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it shall we call fat people people of sizeby the way i think the whole reason we are encouraged in this country to think of ourselves as black and white instead of pink and brown which is what we are is that black and white are complete opposites that cannot be reconciled black and white can never come together pink and brown on the other hand might just stand a chance of being blended might just come together cant have that doesnt fit the plani also dont say africanamerican i find it completely confusing which part of africa are we talking about what about egypt egypt is in africa egyptians arent black theyre like the people in india theyre the dark brown white people but theyre africans so why wouldnt an egyptian who becomes a us citizen be an africanamericanthe same thing goes for the republic of south africa suppose a white racist from south africa becomes an american citizen well first of all hed find plenty of company but couldnt he also be called an african american it seems to me that a racist white southafrican guy could come here and call himself africanamerican just to piss off black people and by the way what about a black person born in south africa who moves here and becomes a citizen what is he is he a africansouthafricanamerican or a southafricanafricanamerican all right back to the hemisphere how about a black women who is a citizen of jamaica according to pc doctrine shes africanjamaican right but if she becomes a us citizen shes a jamaicanamerican and yet if one of these language crusaders saw her on the street hed think she was africanamerican unless he knew her personally in which case hed have to decide between africanjamaicanamerican and jamaicanafricanamerican ya know its just so much liberal bullshit labels divide people we need fewer labels not morei am an army brat  that is someone who doesnt really belong anywhere anymore but has to fake it their entire life that they do  but now i find that i am in the vanguard of the culture  so many americans have the same experience of being displaced and not belonging anywhere because of the widespread moving away from ones roots that it has become normal  so to feel we have roots we turn to things like pop music which is now commercialized  so our roots are not roots at all but we are just consumers being manipulated by our own narcissismyour email address

moments that seem to last forever have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife huh who her oh hell yeah well its one of lifes little moments isnt it its one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time you cant postpone that you cant put that off and be walking around like this youve got to get in there and clear that thing out youve got to rescue your underwear theres a letter in your mailbox thats right and you have to rectify that situation so that you can move along to your next embarrassing moment which is probably scheduled immediately thats the way life is full of those little moments everybody knows them everybody recognizes them you ever been at a really loud party i mean a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly and in order to be heard even by the person standing right next to you youve got to be screaming at the top of your lungs but every now and then at a party it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time and only your voice can be heard right i know i know well what im going to do im going to have my testicles laminated lifes little moments you ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt and you have to just kind of keep talking you know and make believe its part of the design works all right if youre wearing a hawaiian shirt but otherwise theyre going to notice ed you got a big snot on your shirt some guys are really cruel you know and some of these things are not even your fault these little things that happen you didnt cause the situation a lot of time youre the victim you walk into some situation and suddenly youre the one whos taking all the heat not your fault give you an example of the kind of thing i mean did you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guys hand and you suddenly realize he doesnt have a complete hand and you got to make believe it feels great right you cant go ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhhh you cant do that its not even an option you got to hang in there and say hi hey swell hand give me three hi  yo not your fault you didnt cause that you werent even there when it happened to the guyyou were probably out walking your dog which is what im usually doing walking my dog because i love my dog i love all my dogs i love every dog i ever had i remember them all and i love every one of them still love all my dogs and ive had me a lot of god damn dogs in my lifetime i have had me a bunch of different dogs because you do keep getting a new dog dont you you just keep getting one dog after another thats the whole secret of life life is a series of dogs its true you just keep getting a new dog dont you thats whats good about them they dont live too long and you can go get a new god damn dog sometimes you can get a dog looks exactly like the dog you used to have right you shop around a little bit you can find a dog identical to your former dog and thats real handy because you dont have to change the pictures on your mirror or anything right you just bring the dead one into the pet shop throw him up on the counter say give me another one of them that was real good and theyll give you a carbon copy of your exgod damn dog now my favorite dog that i ever had in my whole lifetime was tippie tippie was a good dog some of you remember ive talked about tippie tippie was a good dog tippie was a mixed terrier you know that word mixed that the veterinarian puts on the form when even he dont know what the fuck you got you bring in a little mixed puppy to a veterinarian and say what is it hell say well its definitely not a monkey tippie was actually part dodge dart poor tippie was full of guilt so much so in fact shes the only dog i ever had who committed suicide yeah well we dont say it like that around the house we say she put herself to sleep but she ran out in front of a milk truck thats fucking suicide but that was her decision thats what tippie wanted to do and thats the way it is in our family if you want to commit suicide we back you up so we supported tippie in her little suicide decision then we brought her into the pet shop threw her up on the counter and said give us something bigger were trading up we was looking for a bigger god damn dog because tippie had been teenie even before the truck came by the truck had made her teenier wider but teenier and we was looking for a bigger god damn dog not too big you know i dont like a dog whos bigger than i am its bad enough looking for shit in one direction without having to duck flying turds as well a good rule of thumb is keep the dogs asshole below eye level so we compromised and we got us a midsized dog knee high just about like this size here best size you can own by the way most people know this is the ideal size dog to have you know why anybody comes to visit you the first thing that dog does is take his nose and put it right in their crotch oohh oohh he smells my dog no marge i dont believe thats the animal he has in mind and people get embarrassed by that especially the owner of the dog the owners the one whos saying stop that stop that will you stop that now stop it im awfully sorry about this not me i say get in there and get some of that get in there and sniff that thing out go on listen would you mind spreading your legs a little bit so he can get right in there yeah stand like this for a little while would you okay looking good now so hows your mom and dad doing anyway well god bless them its a wonderful couple go around the back check it out in the back sniff that other thing in the back there whats that well theres two different smells he likes what can i tell you dont pay him no attention hell be finished in just about half an hour so listen reverend its real nice of you to come and call on us like this every one of us is always glad to see you around here especially that god damn dog those dogs are great theyll break the ice when a new neighbor comes to call hi were the johnsons whats his name ball sniffer hes a crotch hound let me know if you want to get circumcised hes on duty till  oclock dogs are a constant source of entertainment did you ever have a dog that ate cat turds some of them do some of you must know that did you ever have a dog eat cat turds yeah of course you got to have a cat you know you cant be buying cat turds at the supermarket but its true some dogs will eat cat turds yeah dont let them lick you that day get a bottle of listerine for him try to make him gargle pour it down his throat and tell him to howl come on howl howl god damn it stomp on his tail howl i said god damn it howl oh dogs are a lot of fun did you ever have a dog that ate a bunch of colored balloons and then he takes a shit and its real decorative like or sometimes at christmas theyll eat some tinsel and take a shiny shit wow look mom can we hang it on the tree well it is considered good luck in some cultures heres a little household hint for you this will help you clean up after your dogs feed your dog a lot of rubber bands put a lot of rubber bands in with his regular food then when he takes a shit theres usually a little loop in the end of it you just pick it up by the loop do you know what i mean throw it in the neighbors yard yeah thats why i travel around give these little household hints bet you never read that one in heloise huhyeah about time for me to get a little drink of water figure this stuff is safe to drink huh actually i dont care if its safe or not i drink it anyway you know why because im an american and i expect a little cancer in my food and water thats right im a loyal american and im not happy unless ive let government and industry poison me a little bit every day let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here ah a little cancer never hurt anybody everybody needs a little cancer i think its good for you keeps you on your toes besides i aint afraid of cancer i had broccoli for lunch broccoli kills cancer a lot of people dont know that its not out yet its true you find out you got some cancer get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli thatll wipe it right out in a day or two cauliflower too cauliflower kills the really big cancers the ones you can see through clothing from across the street broccoli kills the little ones the ones that are slowly eating you away from inside while your god damn goofy halfeducated doctor keeps telling you youre doing fine jim in fact bring your doctor a bowel of broccoli hes probably got cancer too probably picked it up from you they dont know what theyre doing its all guesswork in a white coat here let me have a few more sips of industrial waste ah maybe maybe i can turn them cancers against one another thats what you got to hope for you know that you get more than one cancer so they eat each other up instead of you in fact the way i look at it the most cancer you got the healthier you are well i know some people dont like you to talk about those things i know that some people dont like you to mention certain things some people dont want you to say this some people dont want you to say that some people think if you mention some things they might happensome people are really fucking stupid did you ever notice that how many really stupid people you run into during the day god damn theres a lot of stupid bastards walking around carry a little pad and pencil with you you wind up with  or  names by the end of the day look at it this way think of how stupid the average person is and then realize half of them are stupider than that and it doesnt take you very long to spot one of them does it take you about eight seconds youll be listening to some guy and say this guy is fucking stupid then then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre full of shit huh that doesnt take very long to spot either does it take you about the same amount of time youll be listening to some guy saying well hes fairly intelligent ah hes full of shit then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre not full of shit theyre fucking nuts dan quayle is all three all three stupid full of shit and fucking nuts and where did he get that wife of his have you taken a good look at that marilyn quayle where did he get her at a halloween party or something she looks like prince charles for christs sake let me ask you something does he actually have to fuck that woman huh god help him i wouldnt fuck her with a stolen dickthats my political humor people like it when youre topical oh some people dont like you to talk like that oh some people would like to shut you up for saying those things you know that lots of people lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk tell you what you cant talk about sometimes theyll say well you can talk about something but you cant joke about it say you cant joke about it because its not funny comedians run into that shit all the time like rape theyll say you cant joke about rape rapes not funny i say fuck you i think its hilarious how do you like that i can prove to you that rape is funny picture porky pig raping elmer fudd see hey why do you think they call him porky huh i know what youre going to say elmer was asking for it elmer was coming on to porky porky couldnt help himself he got a hardon he got horny he lost control he went out of his mind lot of men talk like that lot of men think that way they think its the womans fault they like to blame the rape on the woman say hey she had it coming she was wearing a short skirt these guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers dont seem fair to me dont seem right but you can joke about it i believe you can joke about anything it all depends on how you construct the joke what the exaggeration is what the exaggeration is because every joke needs one exaggeration every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion give you an example did you ever see a news story like this is the paper every now and then you run into a story that says some guy broke into a house stole a lot of things and while he was in there he raped an  old woman and im thinking to myself why what the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have i want to say why did you do that well she was coming on to me we were dancing and i got horny hey she was asking for it she had on a tight bathrobe i say jesus christ be a little fucking selective next time will you now speaking of rape you know what i wonder i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole these are the kind of things i think about when im sitting home alone and the power goes out i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole i mean per capita i know the populations are different most people think its the equator i think its the north pole people think its the equator because its hot down there they dont wear a lot of clothing guys can see womens tits they get horny and theres a lot of fucking going on thats exactly why theres less rape at the equator because theres a lot of fucking going on you can tell theres a lot of fucking at the equator take a look at the population figures billions of people life near the equator how many eskimos we got   no ones getting laid at the north pole its too fucking cold guys say to their wives hey tonight honey huh tonight huh are you crazy the wind chill factor is  below these guys are deprived theyre horny theyre pent up every now and then they bust out they got to rape somebody now the biggest problem an eskimo rapist has trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman whos kicking did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesnt want to take them off you would lose your hard on in the process up at the north pole your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes thats another thing i wonder i wonder does a rapist have a hard on when he leaves the house in the morning or does he develop it during the day when hes walking around looking for somebody these are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schoolsnow i probably got the feminists all pissed off at me because im joking about rape feminists want to control your language feminists want to tell you how to talk and theyre not alone theyre not alone im not picking on the feminists they got a lot of company in this country theres a lot of groups lot of institutions in this country want to control your language tell you what you can say and what you cant say government wants to tell you some things you cant say because theyre against the law or you cant say this because its against a regulation or heres something you cant say because its a secret you cant tell him that because hes not cleared to know that government wants to control information and control language because thats the way you control thought and basically thats the game theyre insame with religion religion is nothing but mind control religion is just trying to control your mind control your thoughts so theyre going to tell you some things you shouldnt say because theyre sins and besides telling you things you shouldnt say religions going to suggest to you some things you ought to be saying heres something you ought to say first thing when you wake up in the morning heres something you ought to say just before you go to sleep at night heres something we always say on the third wednesday in april after the first full moon in spring at  when the bells ring religion is always suggesting things you ought to be saying same with political groups of all kinds political activists antibiased groups special interest groups are going to suggest the correct political vocabulary the way you ought to be saying things and thats where the feminists come innow as i said i got nothing against the feminists in fact i happen to agree with most of the feminist philosophy i have read i agree for instance that for the most part men are vain ignorant greedy brutal assholes whove just about ruined this planet\\u2026 whove just about ruined this planet because theyre afraid someone might have a bigger dick out there somewhere men are basically insecure about the size of their dicks and so they go to war over it you dont have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work it goes something like this what they have bigger dicks bomb them and of course the bombs and the bullets and the rockets are all shaped like dicks i dont understand that part of it but it is part of the equation so i agree with that abstract that man men males have pushed the technology that just about has this planet in a stranglehold mother earth raped again guess who eh she was asking for it i also happen to like it when feminists attack these fat ass housewives who think theres nothing more to life than sitting home on the telephone drinking coffee watching tv and pumping out a baby every nine months ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom will seven be enough bob ba boom ba boom but whats the alternative whats the alternative to pumping out a unit every nine months pointless careerism putting on a man tailored suit with shoulder pads and imitating all the worst behavior of men this is the noblest thing that women can think of to take a job in a criminal corporation thats poisoning the environment and robbing customers out of their money this is the worthiest thing they can think of isnt there something nobler they can do to be helping this planet heal you dont hear much about that from these middle class women ive noticed that most of these feminists are white middle class women they dont give a shit about black womens problems they dont care about latino women all theyre interested in is their own reproductive freedom and their pocketbooks but when it comes to changing the language i think they make some good points because we do think in language and so the quality of our thoughts and ideas could only be as good as the quality of our language so maybe some of this patriarchal shit ought to go away i think spokesmen ought to be spokesperson i think chairman ought to be chairperson i think mankind ought to be humankind but they take it too far they take themselves too seriously the exaggerate they want me to call that thing in the street a person hole cover i think thats taking it a little bit too far what would you call a ladys man a persons person that would make a heman an it person little kids would be afraid of the boogie person theyd look up in the sky and see the person in the moon guys would say come back here and fight like a person and wed all sing for its a jolly good person thats the kind of thing you would hear on late night with david letterperson you know what i mean so i think its an exaggeration and i like to piss off any group that takes itself a little bit too seriously and it does not take a lot of imagination to piss off a feminist all you got to do is run into now headquarters or ms magazine and say hey which one of you cute little cupcakes wants to come home and cook me a nice meal and give me a blow job blow job oh that pisses them off you want to piss off a feminist call her a cum catcher thatll get her attention ah dont act disgusted dont act disgusted half of you are going to go home and go down on each other tonight remember if youre willing to swallow cum lets not make believe something i said was disgusting okay all right lets not have a double standard here one standard will do just finenow speaking of blowjobs do you know why they call it a blowjob so itll sound like it has kind of a work ethic attached to it make you feel like you did something useful for the economy long as im being a complete pig up here let me ask you guys a question let me ask one question of the men are you ever able to watch a woman eating a banana and not think about a blowjob huh i cant do it i cant do it and i know why im a sick evil fuck i know that i accept that but i cant do it eating a banana eating a pickle licking on an ice cream cone im saying to myself look at the tongue on her wow so you women be careful when youre standing out in front of that hagen daas because god damn it were watching and god damn it were thinking another womans issue prostitution i do not understand why prostitution is illegal why should prostitution be illegal selling is legal fucking is legal why isnt selling fucking legal you know why should it be illegal to sell something thats perfectly legal to give away i cant follow the logic on that at all of all the things you can do too a person giving someone an orgasm is hardly the worst thing in the world in the army they give you a medal for spraying napalm on people civilian life you go to jail for giving someone an orgasm maybe im not supposed to understand iti got strange ideas anyway you know what i think they ought to do with that miss american contest i think they ought to make the losers keep coming back until they win ill tell you that would get a little spooky after about  years or so huh i just want to work on world peace fine sit down before you fall down will you and pick up all these goddamn batons i got a lot of ideas you know what i think i think kleenex ought to have little targets on them wouldnt that be a good idea little bulls eyes right in the middle of the kleenex make it kind of sporting when youre with your friends blowing nose sound look dave an  thats a good idea i got a lot of good ideas trouble is most of them suck i got a lot of good ideas for new products like that thats what i think about on my off duty hours things we need products we ought to have that we dont have you know what we ought to have we ought to have a diet salad dressing called  islands see good god damn ideas like that huh a christian deodorant thou shalt not smell how about a feminine hygiene spray called sprunt huh well youd never forget the name would you it would always be on the tip of your tongue see marketing marketing thats where i belong among other places marketing heres an idea i got this is a yoyo with a  string you use it when you visit the grand canyon see im a visionary im ahead of my time trouble is im only about an hour and a half ahead heres a good idea a light bulb that only shines on things worth looking at yeah kind of too idealistic never make any money on a thing like that heres something thats going to make you a fortune get in on this this is a roach spray it doesnt kill the roaches but it fills them with selfdoubt as to whether or not theyre in the right house yeah heres something im trying to interest the japanese electronics firms in this this would be a great product for sony this is a combination cassette player

knew a family and one of them was a homosexual and he was in an automobile accident and he was comatose you could always comfort that family by saying well look at it this way he was a fruit now hes a vegetable listen at least hes still in the produce sectionnow i probably got some other group pissed off at me because i said fruit theres a different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything youre not supposed to say cant say fruit cant say faggot cant say queer cant say nancy boy cant say pansy cant say ngger boogie jig jiggaboo skinhead jungle bunny moolie moolie yan or schwarz cant say yid heeb zeeb kike mackie dego ginny wop ginzo greaser greaseball spick beaner oya tiger pr mick donkey turkey limey frog squarehead kraut jerry hun chink jap nip slope slopehead zip zipper head gook there is absolutely nothing wrong\\u2026 there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves theyre only words its the context that counts its the user its the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad the words are completely neutral the words are innocent i get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language bullshit its the context that makes them good or bad the context that makes them good or bad for instance you take the word ngger there is absolutely nothing wrong with the word ngger in and of itself its the racist asshole thats using it that you ought to be concerned about we dont care when richard pryor or eddie murphy says it why because we know theyre not racists theyre nggers context context we dont mind their context because we know theyre black hey i know im whitey the blueeyed devil patio fake gray boy honkie motherfucker myself dont bother my ass theyre only words you cant be afraid of words that speak the truth even if its an unpleasant truth like the fact that theres a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country i dont like words that hide the truth i dont like words that conceal reality i dont like euphemisms or euphemistic language and american english is loaded with euphemisms because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality americans have trouble facing the truth so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it and it gets worse with every generation for some reason it just keeps getting worseill give you an example of that theres a condition in combat most people know about it its when a fighting persons nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum cant take any more input the nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap in the first world war that condition was called shell shock simple honest direct language two syllables shell shock almost sounds like the guns themselves that was  years ago then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue four syllables now it takes a little longer to say doesnt seem to hurt as much fatigue is a nicer word than shock shell shock battle fatigue then we had the war in korea in  madison avenue was riding high by that time and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion hey were up to eight syllables now and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase its totally sterile now operational exhaustion sounds like something that might happen to your car then of course came the war in viet nam which has only been over for about  or  years and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war i guess its no surprise that the very same condition was called posttraumatic stress disorder still eight syllables but weve added a hyphen and the pain is completely buried under jargon posttraumatic stress disorder i bet you if wed have still been calling it shell shock some of them viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time but it didnt happen and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language that language that takes the life out of lifeand it is a function of time it does keep getting worse give you another example sometime during my life sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue i wasnt notified of this no one asked me if i agreed with it it just happenedtoilet paper became bathroom tissue sneakers became running shoes false teeth became dental appliances medicine became medication information became directory assistance the dump became the landfill car crashes became automobile accidents partly cloudy became partly sunny motels became motor lodges house trailers became mobile homes used cars became previously owned transportation room service became guest room dining and constipation became occasional irregularity when i was a little kid if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional poor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities and theyre broke theyre broke they dont have a negative cash flow position theyre fucking broke because a lot of them were fired you know fired management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce smug greedy wellfed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins its as simple as that the cia doesnt kill anybody any more they neutralize people or they depopulate the area the government doesnt lie it engages in disinformation the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call sunshine units israeli murderers are called commandos arab commandos are called terrorists contra killers are called freedom fighters well if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part of it to us do they never mention that part of itsome of this stuff is just silly we all know that like on the airlines they say they want to pre board well what the hell is pre board what does that mean to get on before you get onthey say theyre going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance cripples simple honest direct language theres no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary no shame attached to it in fact its a word used in bible translations jesus healed the cripples doesnt take seven words to describe that condition but we dont have any cripples in this country any more we have the physically challenged is that a grotesque enough evasion for youhow about differently abled ive heard them called that differently abled you cant even call these people handicapped anymore theyll say were not handicapped were handy capable these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition somehow youll change the condition well hey cousin doesnt happen doesnt happenwe have no more deaf people in this country hearing impaired no ones blind any more partially sighted or visually impaired we have no more stupid people everybody has a learning disorder or hes minimally exceptional how would you like to be told that about your child hes minimally exceptional oh thank god for that psychologists actually have started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficitsits getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient and we have no more old people in this country no more old people we shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens isnt that a typically american  century phrase bloodless lifeless no pulse in one of them a senior citizen and ive accepted that one ive come to terms with it i know its here to stay well never get rid of it thats what theyre going to be called so ill relax on that but the one i do resist the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they say look at him dan hes  years young imagine the fear of aging that reveals to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone to have to use an antonym and fear of aging is natural its universal isnt it we all have that no one wants to get old no one wants to die but we do so we bullshit ourselves i started bullshitting myself when i got to my s soon as i was in my s id look in the mirror and id say well i guess im getting older older sounds a little better than old doesnt it sounds like it might even last a little longer bullshit im getting old and its okay because thanks to our fear of death in this country i wont have to die ill pass away or ill expire like a magazine subscription if it happens in the hospital theyll call it a terminal episode the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome and if its the result of malpractice theyll say it was a therapeutic misadventure im telling you some of this language makes me want to vomit well maybe not vomit makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spillthank you

of the pictures from the days when my show business career was just starting this is one of the earliest photos of my days as an actor here im playing the part of a baby in an early production of a play called hold onto the rail as proof of the intensity i brought to the role lying nearby you can see a doll that i had recently strangled this is a candid photo of my first manager and i having a business conference in the park where we knew we couldnt be bugged in this photo i am trying out a new funny face that i had been working on for about six months now here i am with uh two of my fellow actors from the west harlem production of either ben hur or the sound of music you cant really tell from what were wearing there because those are our street clothes and the person off to one side is our personal manager who insisted on being in all of our publicity photos this is a rare photo uh this is a photo of me in a singing group called the mills brothers uh we didnt know that there was already a group in existence by that name the mills brothers sued us so we dropped two guys and changed the named to mickey and sylvia this is a picture of the time i came in second in a suntan contest the boy in the middle won but it was uh later he was disqualified when it was discovered he had been using pep pills uh this is the same photo with the negative reversed as you can see the suntans are approximately the same on the back this is me during an early suicide attempt i was despondent at that time because my puberty was coming along very slowly this one was taken during the nationwide search for a replacement for lassie i remember this picture im trying to get my dog spotty a fox terrier to stand up straight and act like a collie uh although he didnt get the part later he did go on to become mars the cat god rest his souls manager this is a picture of me and the boy who doubled for me during my early film career normally i did all my own stunts except for the scenes involving homosexuality of course and this boy served that purpose this is me singing in a trio i had started which was called the inkspots oddly enough the naacp sued the trio and forced me to drop out when i couldnt prove there was such a thing as flesh colored ink this is my first communion picture it was so well received that i decided to use it for publicity and to this day this is the picture that i send out when producers call and ask me if im interested in serious actingand that brings me to today here in phoenix arizona where were going to shoot one of these comedy shows for the

middle of the kleenex i wonder about hats did you ever notice that when you have a hat on for a long time it feels like its not there and then when you take it off it feels like its still there thats creepy i wonder about frogs legs in those restaurants where they serve frogs legs what do they do with the rest of the frog what do they just throw it away i mean they dont have frog torsos on the menu they must be doing something with them they throw them away can you imagine a barrel full of frog bodies in the restaurant and some drunk coming down the alley oh goddamn i wouldnt wanna see that

know theyre purple you look at a blueberry and you see that sucker is purple bleu cheese no bleu cheese is just white cheese with a bunch of mold in it man and bluefish god knows you open one up theyre every color under the sun well enough of that shit i wonder i wonder which came first skilled workers or unskilled and who decided i figure originally all we had was workers and then they decided this is hard and they called themselves skilled and someone else came along they couldnt do it poor unskilled son of a bitch they moved right past his ass man when he was just in the landing area do you think maybe charlie mccarthy has little wooden balls ive always wondered that hi charlie hi charlie you know what i wonder about i wonder we buy flowers why do we buy flowers theyre free

your house and if they die you dont give a shit normally youd be asking for your money back on anything that died are you kidding me these things keeled over on the piano flowers i wonder why ive never seen anyone cleaning a church have you ive never seen someone cleaning a church a lot of things go on in church you never see a cleaning crew going in there with pails and mops and shit it just never happens why dont they clean churches you know why churches dont need to be cleaned they clean themselves overnight thats how they know theyre churches come back the next morning shit its still clean must be a churchdoes the time bother you i get bothered by the time not so much the time itself the people bother me for the time people come up to me on the street im sure youve had this happen to you people come up to you and say what time it is or they might say what time is it i shouldnt get into these ballads youve had people come up to you and say what time is it what time is it as if you personally were responsible for keeping time you know i feel i feel honored first of all that they thought i was the man in charge but i do have to explain you dont see official timekeeper on here do you i dont have the time of course not do you have the time thats another way they say it do you have the time i say uh no i dont believe i do i certainly didnt have it this morning did you leave it somewhere well do you have the time no i dont have the time i use a little of it like everyone you know but i dont have it i think i think the navy has it in washington isnt that they keep it in an observatory thats right sure they let out a little of it each day not too much they wouldnt want to give us too much just enough time sometimes theyll say do you know what time it is and i say yes i hate to disappoint them but there is no time there is no time i dont mean theres no time i mean theres no time when the hell is it we made that whole thing up theres no time we made it up its a manmade invention time there are no numbers up in the sky ive looked theyre not there we made this stuff up when is it when the hell is it when are we i ask you when are we sometimes we think we know where we are but we dont really know when we are when the hell is it all the time zones are different every calendar you run across is different theyll all give you a different answer these are calendars these are made to… to keep track of time everybodys got a different one the chinese are way up there in the  and s hebrew calendar is way up in the  and s were up at about  well shit this aint a couple of weeks these people are off this is thousands of goddamn years that are missing man how did they do that we dont we dont know when the hell is it it could be the middle of last month for all we know i mean time is so weve got it down so perfect that every four years we have to stick in an extra day just to make sure it still works and we call it february  bullshit its march  and i know it it just feels like march  you cant keep track of the time whats the sense give you an example theres a moment coming its not here yet its still on the way its in the future it hasnt arrived here it comes here it is oh shit its gone theres no now theres no now everything is the near future or the recent past but theres no present welcome to the present whoosh gone again its just so imprecise we dont even care to use the minutes and seconds and hours that weve been given everybodys very vague about the time they say what time you got i got uh i got just after just after geez i must be slow i had going on and where did that imprecision begin why is it were not so sure i know one of the clues that happened to me was when they started telling me about moments when i was a kid they were trying to teach me how to tell time and of course you cant tell time time tells you but they were trying they were trying to show me now the big hand i said i dont have a big hand never mind look at the clock and the clock is so wonderful theres so much emotion attached to a clock face i hate digital clocks digital clocks rob me of all the emotional experience of the spatial relationships on that face of the clock isnt it true i mean dont you always feel that this half hour when it comes down from  down to  goes by a lot quicker than this half hour when it has to come up fighting gravity all the way i know it does go a lot quicker yeah oh i got ya yeah ill tell ya ill tell ya this if i only have a half to live i want it to be this one man i wanna last just a little bit longer than this one here its vague thats all im saying its very vague how we treat time we have all these wonderful expressions we say now now is an interesting one when now you want that now yes well would you like to try again or sometimes just now just now did you hear that what just now you must mean just then dont you yes just then but there it goes again when – now – no not now pardon me do you have the time when do you mean now or when you asked me this shit is moving ruth we got a lot of these vague terms right away immediately at once lickety split just like that nothing flat drop of a hat no time at all as quick as you can say jack robinson im sure youve done that to people ill be back before you can say jack robinson jack robinson youre not back how about a jiffy a jiffy or a flash which is quicker a jiffy or a flash i think there are two flashes in a jiffy myself but god knows how many jiffies there are in two shakes of a lambs tail and why did they use two shakes of a lambs tail whats wrong with the basic unit of measurement one shake of a lambs tail we can do our own arithmetic thank you belched a little there tried to swallow that one then we have words like soon soon thats a very emotional word theres a lot of potential for drama in that word soon soon soon is your mother coming home uhhuh when soon real soon as soon as she can sooner than you think thats kind of a spooky one sooner than i think thats a little bit like before you know it ill be back before you know it he did it holy christ look at that and we go on with these terms that we use these vague terms of time one of these days before long any time now well thats true everything is gonna happen any time now any day now thats kind of a snotty one any day now hey ill be giving you that five bucks i owe you bill yeah any day now sooner or later now and then once in a while from time to time in a little while in a little while that will just be a little while thats a wonderful one and i just love that it sounds so benign just a little while couldnt hurt you could it you can wait a little while itll only be a little while longer just a little while thats so different from a short time short time sounds sound almost terminal doesnt it you only have a short time whereas you have a little while oh id rather have a little while than a short time you know weve got long ways we measure time weve got vast distances of time we measure people will say things like kingdom come im… im gonna be standing here till kingdom come shit i dont have that on my watch doomsday you say doomsday till the cows come home now thats an easy one to understand thats long about dusk isnt it if you leave them out overnight theyd burst heres a long period of time forever some people will tell you gosh ive been standing on this line forever look at this dave this man has been standing on line forever he looks fairly fresh to me almost like an eternity people will tell you its… its almost like an eternity as if they had experience with eternities now you must have a favorite period of time i have some favorites i just want to try a few of them on you it isnt easy uh to select a favorite period of time so many of them are attractive but there are little periods of time that um that you might relate to of course the most basic period of time i feel is five minutes that seems to be the one everyone chooses if they need to think of a period of time real quickly they just go five minutes just five minutes ill be there in just five minutes give me five minutes would you please just would you just give me five minutes are you kidding me i can fix that shit in five minutes five minutes thats all most people want five minutes a good solid nice period of time you can do anything for five minutes cant you i mean anything even things you really hate yeah you can probably do it for five minutes hey lets go talk to ted are you kidding teds an asshole look just five minutes huh okay lets give him five minutes not ten ten i cant make now youre getting into double digits youre starting to fool with my head time five ten minutes fifteen minutes is popular you hear fifteen quite a bit but its its sort of an institutional one its kind of an official time period  minutes has a touch of regulatory uh quality to it doesnt it it sounds like something youre not supposed to do or have to do for  minutes fifteen minutes i like  minutes doesnt that sound free compared to   minutes twenty minutes ill be back in  minutes gosh whats he gonna dodo you have those news stories for me maybe lets go to the news reports man tell us whats going on around the world god knows youre not home to find out thank you thank you walter lets do it i just want to keep you up

there was nowhere to go you know when theres nothing left to conquer in your field hey its time to leave and old al had given the ultimate forecast he told us he said one night that the weather will continue to change on and off for a long long time then he was gone from it god bless alokay yes youre all youre all going to die didnt mean to remind you of it but it is on your schedule yes it probably wont happen when you want it usually comes along when youre not expecting generally you have your stamp collection out you know now now just want a little time to put away your hinges you know no theres a time to die and its okay you know its really okay nobody wants to die nobody well you know ha ha most people dont wanna die nobody wants to die boy if you think being sick is no fun dying is really a pain in the ass nobody wants to die people dont mind being dead being dead is great but getting dead nobody wants to get dead so i hope i dont die i wonder how often we think that you know its just under the surface isnt it you go out for the day going out of your house geez i hope i dont die it would really spoil the circus if i were to die geez i hope i dont die comedians dont wanna die its only a metaphor but its true of all of us we dont wanna die out there a comics gonna die i dont want to die geez i was dying out there i was dying it was death out there it was like a morgue i dont wanna die of course if the comedian doesnt die you know if he succeeds if he makes you laugh then he can say i killed em i killed em so its either me or you you know just like on the freeway yeah dying shouldnt be that bad it shouldnt be that bad were all gonna do it its one of the few fair things in life everybody catches it once and dying should be fun there should be some sort of a look ahead i mean after all when you die youre gonna find out where you go havent we been wondering about that a long time where the hell we go isnt that the biggest thing we have to wonder about where the hell do you go i dont know joe thinks he knows i know joe thinks he knows but joe dont know where do we go nobody knows well i think sometimes you go where you think youre gonna go whatever you think youre gonna do thats where youre probably gonna go if you keep saying youre gonna go somewhere chances are you might go there you ever hear those guys say im going to hell dont pray for me dont pray for me im going to hell he is you go where you wanna go i think when you die your soul goes to a garage in buffalo when monte hall dies hell go behind door number  thats it where you wanna go no nobody wants to die and you know part of the reason we dont wanna die is because of that goddamn funeral weve seen it we know how bad news it is that funeral is no fun man if i dont like other peoples funerals i know im not gonna like my own man theres no way i can get behind my own funeral gonna be lying there in a casket theyre gonna put me in the box gonna put me in a convertible with the top down you know thats embarrassing lying there and everybodys looking at you youre dead and theyre looking youre just lying there still people coming over going… they dont know that youre lying there with short pants on and no back in your jacket embarrassing and sometimes theyll come over you know some people it depends on your religion and so forth but they do come right over to the casket a lot of times and theyll go like this and theyre silent for a moment and what theyre doing while theyre silent is theyre subtracting their age from your age so they get a rough estimate on what they have left and they get up and they say dont he look good dont he look good you crazy hes dead i know but he never looked that good well they say the nicest things about you they say the nicest things when you die your popularity goes straight up when you die they say the greatest things there are that can be said theyll even make stuff up if they have to well he was a real asshole but he meant well you know he was a wellmeaning asshole yes you get so popular when you die all the flowers you get think of the flowers you get when you die you get more flowers when you die than you got in your whole life all your flowers arrive at once too late and guys will say oh yeah well you know bill is dead yeah poor bill poor bill is dead yeah poor dave yeah poor dave is gone now ed yeah poor ed is gone dan that motherfucker is still alive isnt he i wish he would die so i could like him reincarnation is another aspect of death that a lot of people will tell you little tales about it reincarnation coming back a lot of folks are sure of it they can come back you come back as something i dont know does it seem right to you that it would work i mean mathematically it doesnt seem to work because originally on this earth we only had well lets say six people i know we had two but its a controversial number lets say at one time there were only there were only six of us about six people six souls and those six people died and those souls went back to the staging area and new people were born and those six souls came back we still only have six souls now we have four billion people claiming to have souls where are all these extra souls coming from someone is printing up souls and it lowers their value the more souls there are the less theyre worth it would seem well somebodys got to think of this shit you know how about the perfect murder ive thought sometimes about the perfect murder you know what you do you pick up one person by the ankles and you beat another person to death with him and they both die and theres no murder weapon hey what happened here sergeant looks like a pedestrian accident to me they must have been moving at quite a clip of course if you should be caught with this perfect murder in progress or even after the fact if you should be caught you might wind up on death row death row wow thats more than just fun aint it i mean theres cats there death row man shit oh well you got that one meal but thats not much of a consolation is it youre gonna get to order your meal big deal why dont you leave me alone im not hungry man they give you that one last meal i say you can have some fun with that last meal i mean if you work it right they gotta give you whatever you want i mean short of elephant steak you know they dont wanna start on a new elephant just for one guy but they gotta give you pretty much what you want thats part of the humanity of what theyre going to do to you yeah you could just order something you know like maybe well shit you tell them you cant decide thats it i cant decide i dont know i dont know if i want steak or lobster you know i mean i really love them both and i honestly cant decide could they kill you i dont think they could kill you if you honestly couldnt decide lie detector truth serum the man honestly doesnt know what he wants we cant very well kill him we cant drag him down the last mile screaming i dont know what i want you gotta give him a chance and then he… well man lives imagine if you worked it out and you kept it going six months man is still alive cant decide on meal three years eight years and then finally youre an honest person so you tell them when you do figure it out and you say ive decided what id like i think ill have steak okay how did you want that oh well my feeling is if youre gonna die you know or if you know hey die big die big nobody wants to just pass away you dont want to be a euphemism do you nobody wants to pass away you know arnie passed away oh really yes well i didnt know that well thats the idea on the other hand dave died oh yes i heard about dave dying thats true i say die big give it a shot man go out big its your chance die big work in a few posthumous reflexes for your friends give them a show before you go entertain and uplift and instruct those you are leaving behind when you die give them a few posthumous reflexes you know the body does store electricity up theres a certain storage of electricity and even a dead body a corpse will occasionally go sound and i say if you have that potential after youre dead use it properly preprogram before you die preprogram some posthumous reflexes that will be entertaining to those youve left behind do something to capture their imagination roll over on the autopsy table thats nice cross your legs scratch your balls do something now the only reason the only reason that i even suggest that you have a choice about what you can do at the moment of death is a very little known and very little understood part of the death process called the twominute warning many people are not aware of it at all the twominute warning just as in football two minutes before you die you receive an audible warning two minutes get your shit together the reason we dont know about it is because the only people who hear it die and i dont think wed believe someone anyway if he told us hed received his twominute warning would you some asshole on the bus hey i just got my twominute warning youd think it was a coach out on the town you know but no the twominute warning does arrive and i say use that time to entertain to leave something behind do something with the two minutes hey if nothing else give a speech a little twominute speech we can all give a little twominute speech just pick some subject youre very fond of and talk about it for two minutes i mean tell them its your last chance to tell them anything so tell them you got two minutes and i mean wax eloquent rise bring it to the rafters and then at the moment of the end you say if this is not the truth may god strike me deadwell that leads me into the filth and uh to kind of wind up thank you you know thats the trouble with it is trying to decide what to call these words man im trying to decide what to call this whole thing you know what are these words that im talkin about theyre just words that weve decided sort of decided not to use all the time thats about the only thing you could really say about them for sure that theyre just some words not many either just a few that weve decided well we wont use them all the time sometimes well hell yeah sometimes its okay but not all the time and theyre the only words that seem to have that restriction i mean there are a lot of words you can say whenever you want you know pneumonia nobody gives you a lot of… all right you cant yell it in the hospital a great deal but what the hell there are words that you can say no problem topography no one has ever gone to jail for screaming topography but there are some words that you can go to jail for there are some words that we just have decided we will not say all the time sometimes okay if youre running through the jungle chasing somebody that were at war with you can holler them if youre shooting a criminal its okay its the all american thing dirty fucking crook but if youre with the bishops wife at lunch its better not to ask for the goddamn lettuce you know what i mean its just like weve decided thered be some words we wont say all the time and i was just trying to find out which words they were for sure all of them i wanted a list cause nobody gives you a list thats the problem they dont give you a list wouldnt you think it would be normal if they didnt want you to say something to tell you what it is nobody even tells you when youre a kid what the words are that youre supposed to avoid you have to say them to find out which ones they are shit ahhhh oh fuck ahhhh thats two oh ma thats enough trial and error huh please ma give me a list huh all right youre six years old now and heres the list of words your dad and i dont ever want to hear you say oh hey thanks ma boy thats gonna save me an ass kicking or two ahhhh ohhh yeah you never know whats gonna be on the list cause its always somebody elses list you didnt make that up somebody told you that shit they told you better… better not say that so youre gonna… and you dont know whats gonna be on their list god peoples lists even change from day to day some people on friday night got a list you know about two or three words sunday morning goddamn theres  words on it these are the same people two days later different list so youve gotta kind of watch out what youre gonna believe from them the trouble is i was trying to find out what these words might be and i wanted to know the ones that you could never say on television i mean the filthy words that are always filthy there are a lot of these little twoway double entendre words that have two meanings words that theyre okay part of the time i call them like parttime filth some of these words theyre only  percent dirty you have words like ass ass is hardly even a dirty word anymore but it has a few meanings that you cant say on television thats what i was talking about what can you say on television thats another one of those places where we cant use these words all the time but some of them are all right some of the time ass is all right on television you can say on television things like well youve made a perfect ass of yourself tonight but you cant say hey lets go get some ass bitch bitch is another word like that same kind of word its only dirty part of the time depends on what you mean by bitch you might be the lady from the san diego zoo visiting one of the tonight shows and you might just have a bunch of little canines with you there one of them is a female and you say theres the bitch johnny and its okay fine just dont refer to the singer the same way thats all is that bitch gonna do another number yes animals are fine on those twoway words and thats it thats what i was trying to find the words that were always dirty not just part of the time but completely filth well in… in looking for these words i kept finding new categories we have so many ways of describing these dirty words its well we have more ways to describe dirty words than we actually have dirty words that seems a little strange to me it seems to indicate that somebody was awfully interested in these words they kept referring to them they called them bad words dirty filthy foul vile vulgar coarse in poor taste unseemly street talk gutter talk locker room language barracks talk bawdy naughty saucy raunchy rude crude lewd lascivious indecent profane obscene blue offcolor risque suggestive cursing cussing swearing and all i could think of was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits man thats all we have shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits that was my original list i knew it wasnt complete but it was a starter set you know …mention wbai shit piss fuck… yes wbai is the one who played them… shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits now that was the original list weve added a few words since then weve added fart turd and twat and i know there are some other words that many of you are wondering about why they havent been considered why they havent shown up on the list thus far were looking at them all very closely some of your favorites might make the list this year asshole ballbag hard on piss hard blue balls… nookie snatch box pussy pecker peckerhead peckertracks jism joint donicker dork poontang cornhole and dingleberry dingleberry a very popular word and to my way of thinking dingleberry a rather innocent sounding word dingleberry sounds christmasy to me you know lets put one on the tree dad so the words as i say shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat now motherfucker came off the list immediately the first day in fact i had a call from an english language purist some guy had to he had to talk you know he got on the phone he tells me i have a duplicate on the list i have a duplication he says motherfucker is a duplication of the word fuck technically because fuck is the root form motherfucker being a derivative therefore it constitutes duplication and i said hey motherfucker how did you get my phone number anyway how did he know i even had a phone i said look man it may be a derivative but you still cant say it you still cant say motherfucker on tv can you he said no but you cant say fuckee fucking fuckola fuckarooni or fuckarino either well i said yeah that would crowd up my list something awful so i just struck that motherfucker away i struck it from the list motherfucker was gone now the list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits does is sound like somethings missing does it sound like an old friend is gone shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits remember the old rhythm shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits cocksucker motherfucker tits now shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits it falls apart it isnt going anywhere and by now cocksucker is the dominant word on the list previously with motherfucker on the list cocksucker was somewhat balanced out they were the only multisyllabic words on the list but now cocksucker stands alone shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker tits and who knows maybe it doesnt belong either after all motherfucker turned out to be a ringer lets take a look at cocksucker see if this one belongs well divide the word cock and sucker from each other those words sucker isnt dirty sucker its suggestive as hell but it isnt dirty and cock thats not dirty all the time thats one of those words thats only partly filthy cock if youre talking about the animal its perfectly all right they used to read that to us from the bible in third grade and we would laugh man cock is in the bible remember the first time you heard about a cock fight what no get out of here get out of here even the word cocksucker itself has been twisted out of all of its original meaning its been distorted for some reason now cocksucker means bad man its a good woman how did they do that how did they do that well tits is on the end of the list shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and you know it doesnt belong on that list i mean it really doesnt belong in with that kind of heavyweight filth tits isnt dirty tits is a cute name cute thing cute idea great fun good name tits hey tits sounds like a friend it sounds like a nickname doesnt it hey tits come here man hey tits i want you to meet toots tits this is toots toots tits tits cute word nice word i love a word that spells the same forwards and backwards like tit dont you think its cute when a word is spelled the same forwards and backwards i always wished my name was otto just so i could walk backwards and yell my name you know otto otto otto well i had strange dreams but the word tit is on the list because you cant say it on television you cant say tit imagine that cant say tits you can say boobs boob is spelled the same forwards and backwards too boobs is all right you cant say tits but you can say boobs in fact boobs is an answer now on match game i had boobs gene boobs  tits  fine maybe you cant say tits you can say teats teats is all right providing youre on at  in the morning and a cow is your guest but you cant say jugs and you cant say knockers you know thats right danny pull on the cows knockers right grab a knocker in each hand that a boy now alternate knockers good deal you cant say that tits tits sounds like a snack you know well i know what youre thinking but tits sounds almost it sounds nabisco to me it sounds like nabisco has… has reserved that name cause tits sounds like a thing at a party pass the tits would you bill say those things are… responding well shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat fart fart is like tit its one of those words that isnt that harmful you know its just a cute kind of a thing farts well farts can be a little harmful it depends it depends on whos cooking but fart fart is a cute… hey kids know farts are okay kids know farts are fun farts are shit without the mess wow yeah same funny sound same vile smell no fuss no muss fart is an interesting word in this respect talking about television fart is extremely interesting because dig this you cant say fart on television we know that you cant say fart and you cant say fuck either on television however you can refer to fucking you can talk about fucking they do that all the time some of the times in the show youre watching two people are probably fucking in the other room fucking is all right fucking is part of the plot a lot of plots are based on fucking will they fuck should they fuck have they fucked did they fuck will they fuck again will they get sick from fucking are they fucking too much will they fuck each others friends will they have a baby from fucking will they be sorry they fucked will they be glad they fucked all fuck stories every honeymoon joke is a fuck joke have you ever noticed it otherwise the people wouldnt be on their honeymoon in the joke theyd be knights or theyd sailors or something theyre on their honeymoon its got to be a fuck joke every little every news… im sorry… every quiz master has stood there with his newlywed couple and said and i understand you folks are on your honeymoon lots of fucking going on here lots of fucking over here so they talk about fucking all they want they just dont call it that they dont call it what it is they call it other things they call it making love which is fine they call it going to bed with someone having an affair sleeping together but they dont call it fucking on the other hand fart not only is fart a word you cant use on television but they never even refer to them thats how bad farts are compared to fucking they dont even refer to farts there are no farts on television youve never seen a reference to a fart ive never seen a fart reference no wouldnt you think that by now one guy would have gone whew whew do you think by now that one guy on the johnny carson panel just once would have said hey ed move down man whew wow that was a clydesdale fart ed give me the lighter will ya johnny wow geez ed next time youre sick you ought to see the nurse you know god its not the smell so much its the burning of my eyes well we might live to see that you never know remember when you were a kid and maybe you were a little boy child like me you had on short pants maybe sitting in church sitting on a wooden bench in church in the middle of the summer with short pants you gotta fart you know and its up to you you gotta work out a little maneuver thats called the one cheek sneak right in tune with the organ thats why they call them pews you know whew whew whew did you ever notice that your own farts smell okay say thats fairly decent i think ill stay home today do some reading in the closet now i mentioned the three extra words fart turd and twat turd is another word you cant say on television turd but you know when you get right down to it who wants to say it i dont even care if i ever hear that one again twat twat is on the list for the same reason it doesnt mean anything else you know it only has that one meaning twats twat and thats that its not like prick prick is one of those parttime dirty words prick is all right you can say prick on television you can say i pricked my finger just dont say you fingered your prick thats all now there are two words left which i will wind this thing up with one of them is not uh dirty all the time one of them is ball or balls is a word thats mostly clean it has many clean meanings but… but it has a couple of meanings that might get you in trouble and ball is one of those words you gotta think about how youre gonna say it and maybe you have to watch out for just a moment but its okay for sports people perfectly all right when youre a kid you grow up they tell ya go play with your ball really but its okay for the sports announcer on the game of the week to tell you that pete rose has two balls on him no problem at all the whole country nods in agreement but the announcer cant tell you that he hurt his balls he cant tell tony kubeck tony i think he hurt his balls on that play it looks like it hes holding onto them well thats right generally when they hurt their balls they hold them and hes holding his and id say hes hurt them never mention ball injuries they dont say the balls were hurt they say groin injuries he had a groin injury do you know why we call it a groin injury thats the noise you make when you get hit there groin now then the other word i wanted to remind you of was the word fuck which of course is the champ of the alltime dirty words when theyre always dirty by god fuck is right at the head of the pack fucks a good strong word its a good strong word for its purpose and its a word that a lot of people have trouble with uh its a… its an honest word its a… its a forceful word it has a lot of emotional baggage with it when you hear the word fuck youre not just hearing the word youre hearing everything you ever heard about fucking i mean we have a lot of attitudes about fucking some of them are rationale and some of them arent some of them have joy in them some have guilt and fear and all sorts of things and the word fuck carries with it a lot of emotional baggage when they say fuck you go what oh oh good oh i thought you meant do it right away god you know its uh its just a word that that well itll clear the room awfully quick in some households its a heavy good strong word its a proud sounding word to me fuck fuck i am fuck who are you fuck of the mountain i just uh i just feel the word is getting a bad shake the word has an image problem the word fuck needs public relations help its just a word you know thats what you have to remember its just a word but its in such bad shape heres a word that started out okay it started out all right nothing wrong with the word fuck originally i mean there it was youre not a bad word youre not a bad word youve just gotten in with bad company people thats all just the word was all it was the word in the original old english as best i can find fuck only meant to hit to smite to… to perhaps hit with a stick to fuck the tree to fuck the rock to fuck thee thats all and pretty soon thats all ill hit you with my dick honey look at that thats all it was just a little ill knock a little fuck on you there thats all it was was a love tap when you get right down to it thats all fuck ever meant all fuck ever meant was to make love and to make life at the same time thats pretty magic i mean pretty noble things we think about making love and making life here was fuck hanging around with words like love and life how did it get such a bad reputation we fucked it up yeah well we… we put the aggression back into the word fuck you fuck you you fuck fuck you you fuck who the fuck do you think youre fucking with some kind of a fuckhead fuck you who the fuck do you think youre fucking with me dont fuck with me ill fuck over you you fuck with me and youll get fucked you fuck dont fuck with me im the fucker dont fuck with the fucker god it sounds like combat man its got an awful lot theres an awful lot of hostility in the way that word is used theres an awful lot of aggression going down in the name of fucking imagine that id just like to help a little my feeling was hey heres a word that uh maybe we could save you know just by paying a little close attention to it the trouble is with all that aggression and all that violence that we lose track of those two things and people start talking about sex and violence like theyre one thing theres some sort of an overlapping theres some sort of a gray area between sex and violence that some people really are confused about there are people running around talking about sex and violence as if its one thing as if it starts with an s and ends with a e were gonna stamp it out of the comics were gonna stamp it out of the dixie cup were gonna stamp it out of homes sex and violence hey they are different after all and some people even like them together there are true people who do like a little violence with their sex im not… i dont care for that myself i like my violence a little earlier in the afternoon you know right around  oclock a real good ass kicking and then everythings all right but uh the word make love not war someone pointed it out finally they made it very clear for us make love not war i wish i had thought of that phrase you know i really would have been very happy with myself if i had thought of that one man i would have retired the same day i would have left my car at the red light man id say thats it folks im going to the beach you got it make love not war well i didnt think of it but i do have my own phrase make fuck not kill its not as graceful a phrase but im not looking to retire either the whole idea of make fuck not kill is simply to switch the meanings of the words i suggest that for one year we trade meanings on fuck and kill just fuck for kill and kill for fuck thats it dont worry about what they really are someone else will take care of real fucking and real killing im just worried about what we call it… them we call them fucking and killing i say switch them around i think it would be an insight i think wed get a new slant on how we feel about these words if we just change fucking for killing for about a year thats all imagine it sure would be fun watching tv during that time huh better get down off the horse sheriff were fixing to fuck you now mad fucker still on the loose not anymore hes made his first big mistake my friend he fucked a cop today that makes him a cop fucker pardon me boys my horse broke his leg im gonna have to fuck him ill be right back shamu the fucker whale and to fuck a mockingbird hold gently by the wings so all im trying to suggest is that fuck you can be a positive phrase if you hear it from across the street… fuck you okayand thank you for being a part of this and i mean it a lot and i thank the people that arent here tonight that were here the other two nights and theres an awful lot of people to thank but i want to do one thing

ladies and gentlemen good evening my name is george carlin and i am a professional comedian as opposed to the kind you run into at work all day long its nice being a comedian there are uh certain advantages naturally and a few disadvantages there are some drawbacks to being a comedian no one on death row has ever said before i die i wanna talk to a comedian you ever hear anyone at the scene of an accident say quick call a comedian for god sakes but it would be kind of fun at an accident to push your way through the crowd and say may i be of help im a professional comedian and sooner or later at least once in your life when the policeman says to you what are you a comedian youve gotta look him right in the eye and say actually yes even criminals have no respect for comedians what do they say first thing they do when they hold you up dont try anything funny first one makes a funny move gets it whenever theyre not looking i go well thats my job thinking up goofy shit thinking up goofy shit coming around every now and then letting you know what it is or reminding you of things you already know but forgot to laugh at the first time they happened we all have things like that you hear it during the day and then you dont remember it at all for instance ive noticed they have disposable douche and im wondering who would want to keep it in the first placei do have a lot some not a lot but i have some notes over here and uh the reason for that is i havent been doing this lately i want to make sure i know and remember everything tonight ive been taking a little time off six months i think i took uh three of them uh quite voluntarily and the other three quite against my will i had a heart attack or as they say in boston i had a heart attack he had a heart attack you hear about george he had a goddamn myocardial infarction i had a heart attack fortunately my pharmacist my cardiologist and my doctor give me cpr but i would like to bring you up to date uh on the comedians health sweepstakes as it stands right now i lead richard prior in heart attacks two to one i am ahead i am ahead thats right now however richard still leads me one to nothing on burning yourself up well the way it happened was first richard had a heart attack then i had a heart attack then richard burned himself up then i said fuck that im gonna have another heart attacki had an interesting morning got into an argument\\u2026 got into an argument with my rice krispies i distinctly heard snap crackle fuck him i dont know which one of them said it i was reaching for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl but i told them i said well you can all just sit right there in the milk far as im concerned you can sit in the milk until i find out which one of you said that a little mass punishment for my breakfast food the idea is to turn them against one another just sit in the milk far as im concerned silly me big punishment thats what they do anyway sit in the milk thats their job thats rice krispies job sitting in the milk youve seen them havent you floating along little beige blisters of air riding proudly in the milk but you cant sink them they float for a long time and you know why they stay together they gather together in little groups little groups of eight ten twelve sometimes fourteen but always an even number if youve noticed its the polarity of the krispies that attracts them they form little colonies of rice krispies but you cant sink them you try to sink them with a spoon they come up over the sides you cant sink them thats what the fruit is for sinking the rice krispies good size peach will take down  or  of them if im really pissed ill drop a watermelon on thembut i say interesting about my morning cause it was its not\\u2026 i dont have a nice day anymore i dont bother much with that i think im beyond that now i think ive outgrown the nice day i think ive had my share why should i be hogging all the really nice ones let somebody else have a few of course everybody still wants me to have one everybody wants me to have a nice day have a nice day yeah yeah yeah wanna give me my fucking change please im triple parked some of them are really insistent i said have a nice day all right all right goddammit all right ill give it a shot thats the trouble with have a nice day it puts all

mouse with gloves and a parka on you know just\\u2026 just waiting for the lights to go out so he can get back to work i guess the worst thing that can happen cleaning out or looking through the refrigerator is to come across\\u2026 something\\u2026 that you cannot identify\\u2026 at all you literally do not know what it is it could be meat it could be cake usually at a time like that ill bluff honey is this good well what is it i dont know ive never seen anything like it it looks like meatcake well smell it actually it has no smell whatsoever its good put it back somebody is saving it

people dont know that they say hitler geez he had a lot of balls\\u2026 onefor some time i was trying to get a list of words together that would fairly represent the dirty words cause nobody gives you a list of dirty words for life have you noticed that theres some words that are perfectly clean but sound like they could be filthy if you gave them just a little help a word like pussyfoot its perfectly clean but when you say pussyfoot theres a little giggle cause people know that with a little help this word could be filthy no matter what form of the verb you try its clean as a verb but pussyfoot could be a noun it could be a noun pussyfoot a rare disorder a female birth defect hello boys i have pussyfoot god you sure do lady and i love them opentoed shoes you have on well id rather have pussyfoot than woodpecker i can say thator beer nuts god that must be awful beer nuts the official disease of milwaukee i know whenever i see the little canister behind the bar i drop in a couple of dollars for beer nuts i think we need a lot more research on beer nuts or cotton balls which is the dreaded final stage of beer nuts when my beer nuts turn to cotton balls ill be heading home to you its an old southern hymnlots of little phrases like that in the language that dont quite say what they mean take a shit is another one take a shit you dont take shit you leave a shit thats the whole idea to leave it i left a shit fine thank you jeff whered you leave it in the icebox im gonna take a shit dont take one of mine i only have two left and the weekend is coming up why dont you go home and take one of your own shits guys always mooching off me he must think im made of shit or something boy that shit dont grow on trees you know well enough of that shit lots of little phrases like thatpick your nose is well blow your nose blow your nose is a phrase imagine that blowing your nose i dont believe they really mean that do you you cant blow your nose i believe its physically impossible to blow your nose you might get somebody else to blow your nose but it would have to be a real good friendcocktails another clean word you can advertise them you can put up signs all over town cocktails as long as you use both halves of the word perfectly fine but you cant advertise either one of those two items if you break those words in half theyll come and take your sign down cocktail its okay it depends on how you say that kind of word you ladies like some cocktails hey lady you want a cocktailcockpit men will actually laugh about that cockpit get it oh yeahbangkok theres a lovely city how would you like to be a hooker in bangkok it would seem like a natural habitatpeacock nbc is really proud of their peacock you know what a female peacock is a peacuntmy list i was just trying to isolate the words that were always filthy not the ones that were sometimes dirty and the original list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits this was all i could think of in one sitting just one try but we had to add some we had shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and then we added fart turd and twat which also dont have other meanings you know twats twat and thats that but after a while it didnt take long well it took quite a while but i finally discovered that there are only two words on the list you really had to deal with to sort of look at the double standard that television uses where language is concerned uh the two words were fart and fuck those are the only two they seem similar because you cant say either one of them you cant say fart and you cant say fuck no matter how cleverly you try to work them in no matter how clinical the conversation is fart and fuck will not show up on the final tape you simply cannot say them but thats where the similarity ends cause at least with the word fuck even though you cant say the word fuck you can talk about fucking oh you can refer to fucking theres lots of fuck talk going on on tv they just dont call it fucking thats the secret they dont use that word theres plenty of fuck talk you see people who wrote a book about fucking youll see a guy on a talk show who wrote a book about fucking how to fuck who to fuck when to fuck why to fuck and how to feel after you fuck this man is a fuck expert and he wrote a fuck book and hes talking to merv griffin about fucking and theyre getting away with it cause they dont call it fucking same with the soap operas everybody you take a look at a soap opera and you know everybody is fucking somebody on a soap opera and if theyre not fucking somebody theyre trying to fuck somebody will he fuck her did he fuck her has he fucked her should he fuck her can he fuck her some more will they fuck too much will they get silly from fucking who is fucking who thats all you want to know is what the fuck is going on on this program here you know that somebody is getting fucked and you think its you so theres lots of fuck talk and theres plenty of fucking on television they just dont call it fucking they call it everything elsenow on the other hand farts not only can you not mention the word fart but you cant refer to farts at all thats how bad farts are theyre worse than fucking you never hear anybody talking about farts on tv youve never seen a guy who wrote a book on farts how to fart who to fart at how to feel after you

few licks on this totally bogus topic before it completely disappears from everyones consciencesfirst i want to be really clear about one thing as far as other peoples feeling are concerned\\u2014especially these victim groups\\u2014when i deal with them as individuals i will call them whatever they want when its one on one if some guy wants me to call him a morbidly obese africanancestored male with a same gendered sexual orientation ill be glad to do that one the other hand if he wants me to call him a fat ngger  than thats what it will be im here to pleaseif i meet a woman who wishes to be to be referred to as a motionimpaired same genderoriented italianamerican who is difficult to deal with fine on the other hand i am perfectly willing to call her a crippled guinea  cnt if she prefers im not trying to change anyones self image but but when i am speaking generally and impersonally about a large group of people i will call them what i think is honest and fair and i will not try and bullshit myselfokay so who exactly are these victims well first of all i dont think everyone who says he is a victim automatically qualifies i dont think a homely disfigured bald minority person with a room temperature iq who limps and stutters is necessarily always a victim although i will say that she probably shouldnt be out trying to get work as a receptionist but maybe thats just the way it oughtta beim more interested in the real victims people who have been fucked over by the system because the united states is a christian racist nation with a rigged economic system run for three hundred years by the least morally qualified of the two sexes there were bound to be some real victims people who have been elaborately fucked overthe way i see it this country has only four real victim groups indians blacks women and gays i purposely left out the spanish and asians because when you look at what happened to the indians and the blacks the spanish and asian people had a walk in the park its not even close not to downplay the shit theyve had to eat but in about one hundred years the spanish and asians are going to be running this country so theyll have plenty of chances to get even with the gray peoplelets get to some of these other nonvictims you probably noticed elsewhere i used the word fat i used that word because thats what fat people are theyre fat theyre not large theyre not stout chunky hefty or plump and theyre not bigboned dinosaurs are bigboned these people are not necessarily obese either obese is a medical term and theyre not overweight overweight implies there is some correct weight there is no correct weight heavy is also a misleading term an aircraft carrier is heavy it is not fat only people are fat thats what fat people are theyre fat i offer no apology for this it is not intended as criticism or insult it is simply descriptive language i dont like euphemisms euphemisms are a form of lying fat people are not gravitationally disadvantaged theyre fat i prefer seeing things the way they are not the way some people wish they werei dont believe groups deserve extraspecial names for instance midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they are not little people infants are little people leprechauns are little people  midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they dont get any taller by calling them little people i wish their lives were different i wish they didnt have to go around starring at other peoples crotches but i cant fix that and im not going to lie about what they are the politically sensitive commandos would probably like me to call them vertically challenged they are not vertically challenged a skydiver is vertically challenged the person who designed the empire state building was vertically challenged midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfsalso crippled people are crippled they are not differentlyabled if you insist on using such tortured language as differentlyabled then you must use it on all of us were all differentlyabled you can do things i cant do i can do things you cant do i can pick my nose with my thumb i can switch hands while masturbating and gain a stroke we are all differentlyabled crippled people are crippled its a perfectly honorable word there is no shame in it its in the bible jesus healed the cripples he didnt engage in rehabilitative strategies for the physically disadvantagedso leaving women and gays aside for a moment ive narrowed it down to blacks and indians lets talk about what we ought to call them and remember this has nothing to do with the people themselves it has to do with the wordsand by the way when it comes to liberal language vandals i must agree with there underlying premise white europeans and their descendants are morally unattractive people who are responsible for most of the worlds suffering that part is easy you would have to be uh visually impaired not to see it the impulse behind political correctness is a good one but like every good impulse in america it has to be grotesquely distorted beyond usefulnessclearly these are victims but i dont agree that these failed campus revolutionaries know what to do about them when theyre not busy curtailing freedom of speech theyre running around inventing absurd hyphenated names designed to make people feel better remember these are the white elitists in there customary paternalistic role protecting helpless inept minority victims  big daddy white boss always knows bestso let me tell you how i handle some of these speech issues first of all i say black i say black because most black people prefer black i dont say people of color people of color sounds like something you see when you are on mushrooms besides the use of people of color is dishonest it means precisely the same thing as colored people if youre not willing to say colored people you shouldnt be saying people of colorbesides the whole idea of color is bullshit anyway what should we call white people people of no color isnt pink a color in fact white people arent really white at all theyre different shades of pink olive and beige in other words theyre colored and black people are rarely black i see mostly different shades of brown and tan in fact some lightskinned black people are lighter than the darkest white people look how dark the people in india are theyre dark brown but theyre still considered white people whats going on here may i see the color chart people of color is an awkward bullshit  liberalguilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it shall we call fat people people of sizeby the way i think the whole reason we are encouraged in this country to think of ourselves as black and white instead of pink and brown which is what we are is that black and white are complete opposites that cannot be reconciled black and white can never come together pink and brown on the other hand might just stand a chance of being blended might just come together cant have that doesnt fit the plani also dont say africanamerican i find it completely confusing which part of africa are we talking about what about egypt egypt is in africa egyptians arent black theyre like the people in india theyre the dark brown white people but theyre africans so why wouldnt an egyptian who becomes a us citizen be an africanamericanthe same thing goes for the republic of south africa suppose a white racist from south africa becomes an american citizen well first of all hed find plenty of company but couldnt he also be called an african american it seems to me that a racist white southafrican guy could come here and call himself africanamerican just to piss off black people and by the way what about a black person born in south africa who moves here and becomes a citizen what is he is he a africansouthafricanamerican or a southafricanafricanamerican all right back to the hemisphere how about a black women who is a citizen of jamaica according to pc doctrine shes africanjamaican right but if she becomes a us citizen shes a jamaicanamerican and yet if one of these language crusaders saw her on the street hed think she was africanamerican unless he knew her personally in which case hed have to decide between africanjamaicanamerican and jamaicanafricanamerican ya know its just so much liberal bullshit labels divide people we need fewer labels not morei am an army brat  that is someone who doesnt really belong anywhere anymore but has to fake it their entire life that they do  but now i find that i am in the vanguard of the culture  so many americans have the same experience of being displaced and not belonging anywhere because of the widespread moving away from ones roots that it has become normal  so to feel we have roots we turn to things like pop music which is now commercialized  so our roots are not roots at all but we are just consumers being manipulated by our own narcissismyour email address

moments that seem to last forever have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife huh who her oh hell yeah well its one of lifes little moments isnt it its one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time you cant postpone that you cant put that off and be walking around like this youve got to get in there and clear that thing out youve got to rescue your underwear theres a letter in your mailbox thats right and you have to rectify that situation so that you can move along to your next embarrassing moment which is probably scheduled immediately thats the way life is full of those little moments everybody knows them everybody recognizes them you ever been at a really loud party i mean a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly and in order to be heard even by the person standing right next to you youve got to be screaming at the top of your lungs but every now and then at a party it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time and only your voice can be heard right i know i know well what im going to do im going to have my testicles laminated lifes little moments you ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt and you have to just kind of keep talking you know and make believe its part of the design works all right if youre wearing a hawaiian shirt but otherwise theyre going to notice ed you got a big snot on your shirt some guys are really cruel you know and some of these things are not even your fault these little things that happen you didnt cause the situation a lot of time youre the victim you walk into some situation and suddenly youre the one whos taking all the heat not your fault give you an example of the kind of thing i mean did you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guys hand and you suddenly realize he doesnt have a complete hand and you got to make believe it feels great right you cant go ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhhh you cant do that its not even an option you got to hang in there and say hi hey swell hand give me three hi  yo not your fault you didnt cause that you werent even there when it happened to the guyyou were probably out walking your dog which is what im usually doing walking my dog because i love my dog i love all my dogs i love every dog i ever had i remember them all and i love every one of them still love all my dogs and ive had me a lot of god damn dogs in my lifetime i have had me a bunch of different dogs because you do keep getting a new dog dont you you just keep getting one dog after another thats the whole secret of life life is a series of dogs its true you just keep getting a new dog dont you thats whats good about them they dont live too long and you can go get a new god damn dog sometimes you can get a dog looks exactly like the dog you used to have right you shop around a little bit you can find a dog identical to your former dog and thats real handy because you dont have to change the pictures on your mirror or anything right you just bring the dead one into the pet shop throw him up on the counter say give me another one of them that was real good and theyll give you a carbon copy of your exgod damn dog now my favorite dog that i ever had in my whole lifetime was tippie tippie was a good dog some of you remember ive talked about tippie tippie was a good dog tippie was a mixed terrier you know that word mixed that the veterinarian puts on the form when even he dont know what the fuck you got you bring in a little mixed puppy to a veterinarian and say what is it hell say well its definitely not a monkey tippie was actually part dodge dart poor tippie was full of guilt so much so in fact shes the only dog i ever had who committed suicide yeah well we dont say it like that around the house we say she put herself to sleep but she ran out in front of a milk truck thats fucking suicide but that was her decision thats what tippie wanted to do and thats the way it is in our family if you want to commit suicide we back you up so we supported tippie in her little suicide decision then we brought her into the pet shop threw her up on the counter and said give us something bigger were trading up we was looking for a bigger god damn dog because tippie had been teenie even before the truck came by the truck had made her teenier wider but teenier and we was looking for a bigger god damn dog not too big you know i dont like a dog whos bigger than i am its bad enough looking for shit in one direction without having to duck flying turds as well a good rule of thumb is keep the dogs asshole below eye level so we compromised and we got us a midsized dog knee high just about like this size here best size you can own by the way most people know this is the ideal size dog to have you know why anybody comes to visit you the first thing that dog does is take his nose and put it right in their crotch oohh oohh he smells my dog no marge i dont believe thats the animal he has in mind and people get embarrassed by that especially the owner of the dog the owners the one whos saying stop that stop that will you stop that now stop it im awfully sorry about this not me i say get in there and get some of that get in there and sniff that thing out go on listen would you mind spreading your legs a little bit so he can get right in there yeah stand like this for a little while would you okay looking good now so hows your mom and dad doing anyway well god bless them its a wonderful couple go around the back check it out in the back sniff that other thing in the back there whats that well theres two different smells he likes what can i tell you dont pay him no attention hell be finished in just about half an hour so listen reverend its real nice of you to come and call on us like this every one of us is always glad to see you around here especially that god damn dog those dogs are great theyll break the ice when a new neighbor comes to call hi were the johnsons whats his name ball sniffer hes a crotch hound let me know if you want to get circumcised hes on duty till  oclock dogs are a constant source of entertainment did you ever have a dog that ate cat turds some of them do some of you must know that did you ever have a dog eat cat turds yeah of course you got to have a cat you know you cant be buying cat turds at the supermarket but its true some dogs will eat cat turds yeah dont let them lick you that day get a bottle of listerine for him try to make him gargle pour it down his throat and tell him to howl come on howl howl god damn it stomp on his tail howl i said god damn it howl oh dogs are a lot of fun did you ever have a dog that ate a bunch of colored balloons and then he takes a shit and its real decorative like or sometimes at christmas theyll eat some tinsel and take a shiny shit wow look mom can we hang it on the tree well it is considered good luck in some cultures heres a little household hint for you this will help you clean up after your dogs feed your dog a lot of rubber bands put a lot of rubber bands in with his regular food then when he takes a shit theres usually a little loop in the end of it you just pick it up by the loop do you know what i mean throw it in the neighbors yard yeah thats why i travel around give these little household hints bet you never read that one in heloise huhyeah about time for me to get a little drink of water figure this stuff is safe to drink huh actually i dont care if its safe or not i drink it anyway you know why because im an american and i expect a little cancer in my food and water thats right im a loyal american and im not happy unless ive let government and industry poison me a little bit every day let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here ah a little cancer never hurt anybody everybody needs a little cancer i think its good for you keeps you on your toes besides i aint afraid of cancer i had broccoli for lunch broccoli kills cancer a lot of people dont know that its not out yet its true you find out you got some cancer get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli thatll wipe it right out in a day or two cauliflower too cauliflower kills the really big cancers the ones you can see through clothing from across the street broccoli kills the little ones the ones that are slowly eating you away from inside while your god damn goofy halfeducated doctor keeps telling you youre doing fine jim in fact bring your doctor a bowel of broccoli hes probably got cancer too probably picked it up from you they dont know what theyre doing its all guesswork in a white coat here let me have a few more sips of industrial waste ah maybe maybe i can turn them cancers against one another thats what you got to hope for you know that you get more than one cancer so they eat each other up instead of you in fact the way i look at it the most cancer you got the healthier you are well i know some people dont like you to talk about those things i know that some people dont like you to mention certain things some people dont want you to say this some people dont want you to say that some people think if you mention some things they might happensome people are really fucking stupid did you ever notice that how many really stupid people you run into during the day god damn theres a lot of stupid bastards walking around carry a little pad and pencil with you you wind up with  or  names by the end of the day look at it this way think of how stupid the average person is and then realize half of them are stupider than that and it doesnt take you very long to spot one of them does it take you about eight seconds youll be listening to some guy and say this guy is fucking stupid then then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre full of shit huh that doesnt take very long to spot either does it take you about the same amount of time youll be listening to some guy saying well hes fairly intelligent ah hes full of shit then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre not full of shit theyre fucking nuts dan quayle is all three all three stupid full of shit and fucking nuts and where did he get that wife of his have you taken a good look at that marilyn quayle where did he get her at a halloween party or something she looks like prince charles for christs sake let me ask you something does he actually have to fuck that woman huh god help him i wouldnt fuck her with a stolen dickthats my political humor people like it when youre topical oh some people dont like you to talk like that oh some people would like to shut you up for saying those things you know that lots of people lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk tell you what you cant talk about sometimes theyll say well you can talk about something but you cant joke about it say you cant joke about it because its not funny comedians run into that shit all the time like rape theyll say you cant joke about rape rapes not funny i say fuck you i think its hilarious how do you like that i can prove to you that rape is funny picture porky pig raping elmer fudd see hey why do you think they call him porky huh i know what youre going to say elmer was asking for it elmer was coming on to porky porky couldnt help himself he got a hardon he got horny he lost control he went out of his mind lot of men talk like that lot of men think that way they think its the womans fault they like to blame the rape on the woman say hey she had it coming she was wearing a short skirt these guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers dont seem fair to me dont seem right but you can joke about it i believe you can joke about anything it all depends on how you construct the joke what the exaggeration is what the exaggeration is because every joke needs one exaggeration every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion give you an example did you ever see a news story like this is the paper every now and then you run into a story that says some guy broke into a house stole a lot of things and while he was in there he raped an  old woman and im thinking to myself why what the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have i want to say why did you do that well she was coming on to me we were dancing and i got horny hey she was asking for it she had on a tight bathrobe i say jesus christ be a little fucking selective next time will you now speaking of rape you know what i wonder i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole these are the kind of things i think about when im sitting home alone and the power goes out i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole i mean per capita i know the populations are different most people think its the equator i think its the north pole people think its the equator because its hot down there they dont wear a lot of clothing guys can see womens tits they get horny and theres a lot of fucking going on thats exactly why theres less rape at the equator because theres a lot of fucking going on you can tell theres a lot of fucking at the equator take a look at the population figures billions of people life near the equator how many eskimos we got   no ones getting laid at the north pole its too fucking cold guys say to their wives hey tonight honey huh tonight huh are you crazy the wind chill factor is  below these guys are deprived theyre horny theyre pent up every now and then they bust out they got to rape somebody now the biggest problem an eskimo rapist has trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman whos kicking did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesnt want to take them off you would lose your hard on in the process up at the north pole your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes thats another thing i wonder i wonder does a rapist have a hard on when he leaves the house in the morning or does he develop it during the day when hes walking around looking for somebody these are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schoolsnow i probably got the feminists all pissed off at me because im joking about rape feminists want to control your language feminists want to tell you how to talk and theyre not alone theyre not alone im not picking on the feminists they got a lot of company in this country theres a lot of groups lot of institutions in this country want to control your language tell you what you can say and what you cant say government wants to tell you some things you cant say because theyre against the law or you cant say this because its against a regulation or heres something you cant say because its a secret you cant tell him that because hes not cleared to know that government wants to control information and control language because thats the way you control thought and basically thats the game theyre insame with religion religion is nothing but mind control religion is just trying to control your mind control your thoughts so theyre going to tell you some things you shouldnt say because theyre sins and besides telling you things you shouldnt say religions going to suggest to you some things you ought to be saying heres something you ought to say first thing when you wake up in the morning heres something you ought to say just before you go to sleep at night heres something we always say on the third wednesday in april after the first full moon in spring at  when the bells ring religion is always suggesting things you ought to be saying same with political groups of all kinds political activists antibiased groups special interest groups are going to suggest the correct political vocabulary the way you ought to be saying things and thats where the feminists come innow as i said i got nothing against the feminists in fact i happen to agree with most of the feminist philosophy i have read i agree for instance that for the most part men are vain ignorant greedy brutal assholes whove just about ruined this planet\\u2026 whove just about ruined this planet because theyre afraid someone might have a bigger dick out there somewhere men are basically insecure about the size of their dicks and so they go to war over it you dont have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work it goes something like this what they have bigger dicks bomb them and of course the bombs and the bullets and the rockets are all shaped like dicks i dont understand that part of it but it is part of the equation so i agree with that abstract that man men males have pushed the technology that just about has this planet in a stranglehold mother earth raped again guess who eh she was asking for it i also happen to like it when feminists attack these fat ass housewives who think theres nothing more to life than sitting home on the telephone drinking coffee watching tv and pumping out a baby every nine months ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom will seven be enough bob ba boom ba boom but whats the alternative whats the alternative to pumping out a unit every nine months pointless careerism putting on a man tailored suit with shoulder pads and imitating all the worst behavior of men this is the noblest thing that women can think of to take a job in a criminal corporation thats poisoning the environment and robbing customers out of their money this is the worthiest thing they can think of isnt there something nobler they can do to be helping this planet heal you dont hear much about that from these middle class women ive noticed that most of these feminists are white middle class women they dont give a shit about black womens problems they dont care about latino women all theyre interested in is their own reproductive freedom and their pocketbooks but when it comes to changing the language i think they make some good points because we do think in language and so the quality of our thoughts and ideas could only be as good as the quality of our language so maybe some of this patriarchal shit ought to go away i think spokesmen ought to be spokesperson i think chairman ought to be chairperson i think mankind ought to be humankind but they take it too far they take themselves too seriously the exaggerate they want me to call that thing in the street a person hole cover i think thats taking it a little bit too far what would you call a ladys man a persons person that would make a heman an it person little kids would be afraid of the boogie person theyd look up in the sky and see the person in the moon guys would say come back here and fight like a person and wed all sing for its a jolly good person thats the kind of thing you would hear on late night with david letterperson you know what i mean so i think its an exaggeration and i like to piss off any group that takes itself a little bit too seriously and it does not take a lot of imagination to piss off a feminist all you got to do is run into now headquarters or ms magazine and say hey which one of you cute little cupcakes wants to come home and cook me a nice meal and give me a blow job blow job oh that pisses them off you want to piss off a feminist call her a cum catcher thatll get her attention ah dont act disgusted dont act disgusted half of you are going to go home and go down on each other tonight remember if youre willing to swallow cum lets not make believe something i said was disgusting okay all right lets not have a double standard here one standard will do just finenow speaking of blowjobs do you know why they call

doesnt it bother you people that announce it ill be right back im going to take a shit never mind do what you have to do and leave me out of it and dont describe it when you come back boy you should

wallet right next to your drivers license in your wallet little card youre supposed to fill it out and on it youre supposed to list the organs youre willing to give in case you die are these people out of their fucking minds or something do you honestly believe that if a paramedic finds that card on you in an automobile accident hes going to try to save your life bullshit hes looking for parts man absolutely look dan heres that lower intestine weve been looking for never mind the oxygen this mans a donor bullshit they want something of mine they can have my rectum and my anus thats all im

respect for the brain dead hey you got to be brain dead to watch geraldo in the first place you might as well watch him when youre clinically brain dead theres one other thing i thought about concerning this comatose thing and this might help you someday this little piece of information might come in handy sometime in the future if youre in this circumstance if you knew a family if you knew a family and one of them was a homosexual and he was in an automobile accident and he was comatose you could always comfort that family by saying well look at it this way he was a fruit now hes a vegetable listen at least hes still in the produce sectionnow i probably got some other group pissed off at me because i said fruit theres a different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything youre not supposed to say cant say fruit cant say faggot cant say queer cant say nancy boy cant say pansy cant say ngger boogie jig jiggaboo skinhead jungle bunny moolie moolie yan or schwarz cant say yid heeb zeeb kike mackie dego ginny wop ginzo greaser greaseball spick beaner oya tiger pr mick donkey turkey limey frog squarehead kraut jerry hun chink jap nip slope slopehead zip zipper head gook there is absolutely nothing wrong\\u2026 there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves theyre only words its the context that counts its the user its the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad the words are completely neutral the words are innocent i get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language bullshit its the context that makes them good or bad the context that makes them good or bad for instance you take the word ngger there is absolutely nothing wrong with the word ngger in and of itself its the racist asshole thats using it that you ought to be concerned about we dont care when richard pryor or eddie murphy says it why because we know theyre not racists theyre nggers context context we dont mind their context because we know theyre black hey i know im whitey the blueeyed devil patio fake gray boy honkie motherfucker myself dont bother my ass theyre only words you cant be afraid of words that speak the truth even if its an unpleasant truth like the fact that theres a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country i dont like words that hide the truth i dont like words that conceal reality i dont like euphemisms or euphemistic language and american english is loaded with euphemisms because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality americans have trouble facing the truth so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it and it gets worse with every generation for some reason it just keeps getting worseill give you an example of that theres a condition in combat most people know about it its when a fighting persons nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum cant take any more input the nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap in the first world war that condition was called shell shock simple honest direct language two syllables shell shock almost sounds like the guns themselves that was  years ago then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue four syllables now it takes a little longer to say doesnt seem to hurt as much fatigue is a nicer word than shock shell shock battle fatigue then we had the war in korea in  madison avenue was riding high by that time and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion hey were up to eight syllables now and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase its totally sterile now operational exhaustion sounds like something that might happen to your car then of course came the war in viet nam which has only been over for about  or  years and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war i guess its no surprise that the very same condition was called posttraumatic stress disorder still eight syllables but weve added a hyphen and the pain is completely buried under jargon posttraumatic stress disorder i bet you if wed have still been calling it shell shock some of them viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time but it didnt happen and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language that language that takes the life out of lifeand it is a function of time it does keep getting worse give you another example sometime during my life sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue i wasnt notified of this no one asked me if i agreed with it it just happenedtoilet paper became bathroom tissue sneakers became running shoes false teeth became dental appliances medicine became medication information became directory assistance the dump became the landfill car crashes became automobile accidents partly cloudy became partly sunny motels became motor lodges house trailers became mobile homes used cars became previously owned transportation room service became guest room dining and constipation became occasional irregularity when i was a little kid if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional poor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities and theyre broke theyre broke they dont have a negative cash flow position theyre fucking broke because a lot of them were fired you know fired management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce smug greedy wellfed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins its as simple as that the cia doesnt kill anybody any more they neutralize people or they depopulate the area the government doesnt lie it engages in disinformation the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call sunshine units israeli murderers are called commandos arab commandos are called terrorists contra killers are called freedom fighters well if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part of it to us do they never mention that part of itsome of this stuff is just silly we all know that like on the airlines they say they want to pre board well what the hell is pre board what does that mean to get on before you get onthey say theyre going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance cripples simple honest direct language theres no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary no shame attached to it in fact its a word used in bible translations jesus healed the cripples doesnt take seven words to describe that condition but we dont have any cripples in this country any more we have the physically challenged is that a grotesque enough evasion for youhow about differently abled ive heard them called that differently abled you cant even call these people handicapped anymore theyll say were not handicapped were handy capable these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition somehow youll change the condition well hey cousin doesnt happen doesnt happenwe have no more deaf people in this country hearing impaired no ones blind any more partially sighted or visually impaired we have no more stupid people everybody has a learning disorder or hes minimally exceptional how would you like to be told that about your child hes minimally exceptional oh thank god for that psychologists actually have started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficitsits getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient and we have no more old people in this country no more old people we shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens isnt that a typically american  century phrase bloodless lifeless no pulse in one of them a senior citizen and ive accepted that one ive come to terms with it i know its here to stay well never get rid of it thats what theyre going to be called so ill relax on that but the one i do resist the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they say look at him dan hes  years young imagine the fear of aging that reveals to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone to have to use an antonym and fear of aging is natural its universal isnt it we all have that no one wants to get old no one wants to die but we do so we bullshit ourselves i started bullshitting myself when i got to my s soon as i was in my s id look in the mirror and id say well i guess im getting older older sounds a little better than old doesnt it sounds like it might even last a little longer bullshit im getting old and its okay because thanks to our fear of death in this country i wont have to die ill pass away or ill expire like a magazine subscription if it happens in the hospital theyll call it a terminal episode the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome and if its the result of malpractice theyll say it was a therapeutic misadventure im telling you some of this language makes me want to vomit well maybe not vomit makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spillthank you

evening everybody hello there thank you thanks a lothave you noticed that most of the women who are against abortion are women that you wouldnt want to fuck in the first placethank you very much ladies and gentlemen good evening my name is george carlin and i am a professional comedian as opposed to the kind you run into at work all day long its nice being a comedian there are uh certain advantages naturally and a few disadvantages there are some drawbacks to being a comedian no one on death row has ever said before i die i wanna talk to a comedian you ever hear anyone at the scene of an accident say quick call a comedian for god sakes but it would be kind of fun at an accident to push your way through the crowd and say may i be of help im a professional comedian and sooner or later at least once in your life when the policeman says to you what are you a comedian youve gotta look him right in the eye and say actually yes even criminals have no respect for comedians what do they say first thing they do when they hold you up dont try anything funny first one makes a funny move gets it whenever theyre not looking i go well thats my job thinking up goofy shit thinking up goofy shit coming around every now and then letting you know what it is or reminding you of things you already know but forgot to laugh at the first time they happened we all have things like that you hear it during the day and then you dont remember it at all for instance ive noticed they have disposable douche and im wondering who would want to keep it in the first placei do have a lot some not a lot but i have some notes over here and uh the reason for that is i havent been doing this lately i want to make sure i know and remember everything tonight ive been taking a little time off six months i think i took uh three of them uh quite voluntarily and the other three quite against my will i had a heart attack or as they say in boston i had a heart attack he had a heart attack you hear about george he had a goddamn myocardial infarction i had a heart attack fortunately my pharmacist my cardiologist and my doctor give me cpr but i would like to bring you up to date uh on the comedians health sweepstakes as it stands right now i lead richard prior in heart attacks two to one i am ahead i am ahead thats right now however richard still leads me one to nothing on burning yourself up well the way it happened was first richard had a heart attack then i had a heart attack then richard burned himself up then i said fuck that im gonna have another heart attacki had an interesting morning got into an argument\\u2026 got into an argument with my rice krispies i distinctly heard snap crackle fuck him i dont know which one of them said it i was reaching for the artificial sweetener and was not looking directly into the bowl but i told them i said well you can all just sit right there in the milk far as im concerned you can sit in the milk until i find out which one of you said that a little mass punishment for my breakfast food the idea is to turn them against one another just sit in the milk far as im concerned silly me big punishment thats what they do anyway sit in the milk thats their job thats rice krispies job sitting in the milk youve seen them havent you floating along little beige blisters of air riding proudly in the milk but you cant sink them they float for a long time and you know why they stay together they gather together in little groups little groups of eight ten twelve sometimes fourteen but always an even number if youve noticed its the polarity of the krispies that attracts them they form little colonies of rice krispies but you cant sink them you try to sink them with a spoon they come up over the sides you cant sink them thats what the fruit is for sinking the rice krispies good size peach will take down  or  of them if im really pissed ill drop a watermelon on thembut i say interesting about my morning cause it was its not\\u2026 i dont have a nice day anymore i dont bother much with that i think im beyond that now i think ive outgrown the nice day i think ive had my share why should i be hogging all the really nice ones let somebody else have a few of course everybody still wants me to have one everybody wants me to have a nice day have a nice day yeah yeah yeah wanna give me my fucking change please im triple parked some of them are really insistent i said have a nice day all right all right goddammit all right ill give it a shot thats the trouble with have a nice day it puts all the pressure on you now youve gotta go out and somehow manage to have a good time all because of some looselipped cashier have a nice day maybe i dont feel like having a nice day maybe just maybe ive had  nice days in a row and im ready by god for a crappy day i never hear that let them wish one of them hey have a crappy day thank you and to your wonderful family as well a crappy day hey that would be easy its no trouble at all a crappy day just get up theres no planning involved for a crappy dayi know what it is that bothers me about that whole thing its the word nice its just a weak word

relatively okay sometimes ill say im moderately neato if im in a particularly jaunty mood ill say im not unwell thank you that pisses them off because they have to figure that one out for themselvesso\\u2026 it reminds me of something my first grade teacher used to say to me a little lady she used to say you show me a tropical fruit and ill show you a cocksucker from guatemala no that that was someone else that was someone else i think it was someone i met in the army always confuse them i dont know what it isever been looking through the refrigerator and come across an empty plate well that starts me to wondering i think did something eat something else maybe the olives ate the peas maybe that chicken isnt really dead and hes grazing on my stuff actually i picture a little mouse with gloves and a parka on you know just\\u2026 just waiting for the lights to go out so he can get back to work i guess the worst thing that can happen cleaning out or looking through the refrigerator is to come across\\u2026 something\\u2026 that you cannot identify\\u2026 at all you literally do not know what it is it could be meat it could be cake usually at a time like that ill bluff honey is this good well what is it i dont know ive never seen anything like it it looks like meatcake well smell it actually it has no smell whatsoever its good put it back somebody is saving it itll turn up in something thats what frightens mei was what they called a fussy eater hes fussy hes a fussy eater fussy eater is a euphemism for big pain in the ass i mean if i didnt like something i told them i didnt play with my food pick at my food i said i dont like that you make this i dont like it why they wanted reasons well you dont always have a reason i dont know i know i dont like it and i know that if i ate it i would like it even less you like it you eat it then they would try to corner me with logic how do you know you dont like it if youve never even tried it came to me in a dream big pain in the asssome things i didnt like just because of the sound of the foods to this day i can still not eat\\u2026 yogurt yogurt it sounds like its coming up again yogurt yogurt i cant

afoul inside of a tomato it doesnt look right you know it doesnt look like its finished yet for one thing it looks like its in the larval stage or something theres thousands of seeds and a whole bunch of jelly looking stuff get it off my plate its gushy its like that stuff at the end of an egg and i know its not the end of an egg its the beginning of a chicken its hen cum get it off my plate it

a list of dirty words for life have you noticed that theres some words that are perfectly clean but sound like they could be filthy if you gave them just a little help a word like pussyfoot its perfectly clean but when you say pussyfoot theres a little giggle cause people know that with a little help this word could be filthy no matter what form of the verb you try its clean as a verb but pussyfoot could be a noun it could be a noun pussyfoot a rare disorder a female birth defect hello boys i have pussyfoot god you sure do lady and i love them opentoed shoes you have on well id rather have pussyfoot than woodpecker i can say thator beer nuts god that must be awful beer nuts the official disease of milwaukee i know whenever i see the little canister behind the bar i drop in a couple of dollars for beer nuts i think we need a lot more research on beer nuts or cotton balls which is the dreaded final stage of beer nuts when my beer nuts turn to cotton balls ill be heading home to you its an old southern hymnlots of little phrases like that in the language that dont quite say what they mean take a shit is another one take a shit you dont take shit you leave a shit thats the whole idea to leave it i left a shit fine thank you jeff whered you leave it in the icebox im gonna take a shit dont take one of mine i only have two left and the weekend is coming up why dont you go home and take one of your own shits guys always mooching off me he must think im made of shit or something boy that shit dont grow on trees you know well enough of that shit lots of little phrases like thatpick your nose is well blow your nose blow your nose is a phrase imagine that blowing your nose i dont believe they really mean that do you you cant blow your nose i believe its physically impossible to blow your nose you might get somebody else to blow your nose but it would have to be a real good friendcocktails another clean word you can advertise them you can put up signs all over town cocktails as long as you use both halves of the word perfectly fine but you cant advertise either one of those two items if you break those words in half theyll come and take your sign down cocktail its okay it depends on how you say that kind of word you ladies like some cocktails hey lady you want a cocktailcockpit men will actually laugh about that cockpit get it oh yeahbangkok theres a lovely city how would you like to be a hooker in bangkok it would seem like a natural habitatpeacock nbc is really proud of their peacock you know what a female peacock is a peacuntmy list i was just trying to isolate the words that were always filthy not the ones that were sometimes dirty and the original list was shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker and tits this was all i could think of in one sitting just one try but we had to add some we had shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits and then we added fart turd and twat which also dont have other meanings you know twats twat and thats that but after a while it didnt take long well it took quite a while but i finally discovered that there are only two words on the list you really had to deal with to sort of look at the double standard that television uses where language is concerned uh the two words were fart and fuck those are the only two they seem similar because you cant say either one of them you cant say fart and you cant say fuck no matter how cleverly you try to work them in no matter how clinical the conversation is fart and fuck will not show up on the final tape you simply cannot say them but thats where the similarity ends cause at least with the word fuck even though you cant say the word fuck you can talk about fucking oh you can refer to fucking theres lots of fuck talk going on on tv they just dont call it fucking thats the secret they dont use that word theres plenty of fuck talk you see people who wrote a book about fucking youll see a guy on a talk show who wrote a book about fucking how to fuck who to fuck when to fuck why to fuck and how to feel after you fuck this man is a fuck expert and he wrote a fuck book and hes talking to merv griffin about fucking and theyre getting away with it cause they dont call it fucking same with the soap operas everybody you take a look at a soap opera and you know everybody is fucking somebody on a soap opera and if theyre not fucking somebody theyre trying to fuck somebody will he fuck her did he fuck her has he fucked her should he fuck her can he fuck her some more will they fuck too much will they get silly from fucking who is fucking who thats all you want to know is what the fuck is going on on this program here you know that somebody is getting fucked and you think its you so theres lots of fuck talk and theres plenty of fucking on television they just dont call it fucking they call it everything elsenow on the other hand farts not only can you not mention the word fart but you cant refer to farts at all thats how bad farts are theyre worse than fucking you never hear anybody talking about farts on tv youve never seen a guy who wrote a book on farts how to fart who to fart at how to feel after you fart theres no fart experts on the merv griffin show you dont see any farts or fart references its a fart free zone wouldnt you think after  years one guy by now would have gone whew just once just once id like to see someone on the johnny carson panel say hey ed move down man that was a clydesdale fartwell anyway uh after a while i realized that i was needlessly restricting myself to seven words and only to the ones that werent allowed on tv i mean there were a lot more to be looked at and television isnt the only place that objects to your language sometimes there are lots of situations where youre not supposed to say that so i expanded the list by as many as i could and id like to share some with you now this list is a little longer than it was before first we start with the ones we already know shit piss fuck cunt cocksucker motherfucker tits fart turd and twat crap balls prick asshole jackoff jerkoff scumbag douche bag hardon rodon boner stiff piss hard blue balls

from around the world take the stage at londons alexandra palace in this comedy showcase hosted by the awardwinning hannah gadsby\",\n          \"i know im a little late with this but id like to get a few licks on this totally bogus topic before it completely disappears from everyones consciencesfirst i want to be really clear about one thing as far as other peoples feeling are concerned\\u2014especially these victim groups\\u2014when i deal with them as individuals i will call them whatever they want when its one on one if some guy wants me to call him a morbidly obese africanancestored male with a same gendered sexual orientation ill be glad to do that one the other hand if he wants me to call him a fat ngger  than thats what it will be im here to pleaseif i meet a woman who wishes to be to be referred to as a motionimpaired same genderoriented italianamerican who is difficult to deal with fine on the other hand i am perfectly willing to call her a crippled guinea  cnt if she prefers im not trying to change anyones self image but but when i am speaking generally and impersonally about a large group of people i will call them what i think is honest and fair and i will not try and bullshit myselfokay so who exactly are these victims well first of all i dont think everyone who says he is a victim automatically qualifies i dont think a homely disfigured bald minority person with a room temperature iq who limps and stutters is necessarily always a victim although i will say that she probably shouldnt be out trying to get work as a receptionist but maybe thats just the way it oughtta beim more interested in the real victims people who have been fucked over by the system because the united states is a christian racist nation with a rigged economic system run for three hundred years by the least morally qualified of the two sexes there were bound to be some real victims people who have been elaborately fucked overthe way i see it this country has only four real victim groups indians blacks women and gays i purposely left out the spanish and asians because when you look at what happened to the indians and the blacks the spanish and asian people had a walk in the park its not even close not to downplay the shit theyve had to eat but in about one hundred years the spanish and asians are going to be running this country so theyll have plenty of chances to get even with the gray peoplelets get to some of these other nonvictims you probably noticed elsewhere i used the word fat i used that word because thats what fat people are theyre fat theyre not large theyre not stout chunky hefty or plump and theyre not bigboned dinosaurs are bigboned these people are not necessarily obese either obese is a medical term and theyre not overweight overweight implies there is some correct weight there is no correct weight heavy is also a misleading term an aircraft carrier is heavy it is not fat only people are fat thats what fat people are theyre fat i offer no apology for this it is not intended as criticism or insult it is simply descriptive language i dont like euphemisms euphemisms are a form of lying fat people are not gravitationally disadvantaged theyre fat i prefer seeing things the way they are not the way some people wish they werei dont believe groups deserve extraspecial names for instance midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they are not little people infants are little people leprechauns are little people  midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfs they dont get any taller by calling them little people i wish their lives were different i wish they didnt have to go around starring at other peoples crotches but i cant fix that and im not going to lie about what they are the politically sensitive commandos would probably like me to call them vertically challenged they are not vertically challenged a skydiver is vertically challenged the person who designed the empire state building was vertically challenged midgets and dwarfs are midgets and dwarfsalso crippled people are crippled they are not differentlyabled if you insist on using such tortured language as differentlyabled then you must use it on all of us were all differentlyabled you can do things i cant do i can do things you cant do i can pick my nose with my thumb i can switch hands while masturbating and gain a stroke we are all differentlyabled crippled people are crippled its a perfectly honorable word there is no shame in it its in the bible jesus healed the cripples he didnt engage in rehabilitative strategies for the physically disadvantagedso leaving women and gays aside for a moment ive narrowed it down to blacks and indians lets talk about what we ought to call them and remember this has nothing to do with the people themselves it has to do with the wordsand by the way when it comes to liberal language vandals i must agree with there underlying premise white europeans and their descendants are morally unattractive people who are responsible for most of the worlds suffering that part is easy you would have to be uh visually impaired not to see it the impulse behind political correctness is a good one but like every good impulse in america it has to be grotesquely distorted beyond usefulnessclearly these are victims but i dont agree that these failed campus revolutionaries know what to do about them when theyre not busy curtailing freedom of speech theyre running around inventing absurd hyphenated names designed to make people feel better remember these are the white elitists in there customary paternalistic role protecting helpless inept minority victims  big daddy white boss always knows bestso let me tell you how i handle some of these speech issues first of all i say black i say black because most black people prefer black i dont say people of color people of color sounds like something you see when you are on mushrooms besides the use of people of color is dishonest it means precisely the same thing as colored people if youre not willing to say colored people you shouldnt be saying people of colorbesides the whole idea of color is bullshit anyway what should we call white people people of no color isnt pink a color in fact white people arent really white at all theyre different shades of pink olive and beige in other words theyre colored and black people are rarely black i see mostly different shades of brown and tan in fact some lightskinned black people are lighter than the darkest white people look how dark the people in india are theyre dark brown but theyre still considered white people whats going on here may i see the color chart people of color is an awkward bullshit  liberalguilt phrase that obscures meaning rather than enhancing it shall we call fat people people of sizeby the way i think the whole reason we are encouraged in this country to think of ourselves as black and white instead of pink and brown which is what we are is that black and white are complete opposites that cannot be reconciled black and white can never come together pink and brown on the other hand might just stand a chance of being blended might just come together cant have that doesnt fit the plani also dont say africanamerican i find it completely confusing which part of africa are we talking about what about egypt egypt is in africa egyptians arent black theyre like the people in india theyre the dark brown white people but theyre africans so why wouldnt an egyptian who becomes a us citizen be an africanamericanthe same thing goes for the republic of south africa suppose a white racist from south africa becomes an american citizen well first of all hed find plenty of company but couldnt he also be called an african american it seems to me that a racist white southafrican guy could come here and call himself africanamerican just to piss off black people and by the way what about a black person born in south africa who moves here and becomes a citizen what is he is he a africansouthafricanamerican or a southafricanafricanamerican all right back to the hemisphere how about a black women who is a citizen of jamaica according to pc doctrine shes africanjamaican right but if she becomes a us citizen shes a jamaicanamerican and yet if one of these language crusaders saw her on the street hed think she was africanamerican unless he knew her personally in which case hed have to decide between africanjamaicanamerican and jamaicanafricanamerican ya know its just so much liberal bullshit labels divide people we need fewer labels not morei am an army brat  that is someone who doesnt really belong anywhere anymore but has to fake it their entire life that they do  but now i find that i am in the vanguard of the culture  so many americans have the same experience of being displaced and not belonging anywhere because of the widespread moving away from ones roots that it has become normal  so to feel we have roots we turn to things like pop music which is now commercialized  so our roots are not roots at all but we are just consumers being manipulated by our own narcissismyour email address

moments that seem to last forever have you ever been in a serious social situation when you suddenly realize you have to pull the underwear out of the crack in your ass do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife huh who her oh hell yeah well its one of lifes little moments isnt it its one of those little moments you have to deal with at the time you cant postpone that you cant put that off and be walking around like this youve got to get in there and clear that thing out youve got to rescue your underwear theres a letter in your mailbox thats right and you have to rectify that situation so that you can move along to your next embarrassing moment which is probably scheduled immediately thats the way life is full of those little moments everybody knows them everybody recognizes them you ever been at a really loud party i mean a good loud party where the music is playing too loud and everybody is talking too loudly and in order to be heard even by the person standing right next to you youve got to be screaming at the top of your lungs but every now and then at a party it seems as though everyone shuts up at the same time and only your voice can be heard right i know i know well what im going to do im going to have my testicles laminated lifes little moments you ever been talking to someone and you laugh through your nose and blow a snot on your shirt and you have to just kind of keep talking you know and make believe its part of the design works all right if youre wearing a hawaiian shirt but otherwise theyre going to notice ed you got a big snot on your shirt some guys are really cruel you know and some of these things are not even your fault these little things that happen you didnt cause the situation a lot of time youre the victim you walk into some situation and suddenly youre the one whos taking all the heat not your fault give you an example of the kind of thing i mean did you ever meet somebody and you go to shake the guys hand and you suddenly realize he doesnt have a complete hand and you got to make believe it feels great right you cant go ahhhhhhhh ahhhhhhhh ahhhhh you cant do that its not even an option you got to hang in there and say hi hey swell hand give me three hi  yo not your fault you didnt cause that you werent even there when it happened to the guyyou were probably out walking your dog which is what im usually doing walking my dog because i love my dog i love all my dogs i love every dog i ever had i remember them all and i love every one of them still love all my dogs and ive had me a lot of god damn dogs in my lifetime i have had me a bunch of different dogs because you do keep getting a new dog dont you you just keep getting one dog after another thats the whole secret of life life is a series of dogs its true you just keep getting a new dog dont you thats whats good about them they dont live too long and you can go get a new god damn dog sometimes you can get a dog looks exactly like the dog you used to have right you shop around a little bit you can find a dog identical to your former dog and thats real handy because you dont have to change the pictures on your mirror or anything right you just bring the dead one into the pet shop throw him up on the counter say give me another one of them that was real good and theyll give you a carbon copy of your exgod damn dog now my favorite dog that i ever had in my whole lifetime was tippie tippie was a good dog some of you remember ive talked about tippie tippie was a good dog tippie was a mixed terrier you know that word mixed that the veterinarian puts on the form when even he dont know what the fuck you got you bring in a little mixed puppy to a veterinarian and say what is it hell say well its definitely not a monkey tippie was actually part dodge dart poor tippie was full of guilt so much so in fact shes the only dog i ever had who committed suicide yeah well we dont say it like that around the house we say she put herself to sleep but she ran out in front of a milk truck thats fucking suicide but that was her decision thats what tippie wanted to do and thats the way it is in our family if you want to commit suicide we back you up so we supported tippie in her little suicide decision then we brought her into the pet shop threw her up on the counter and said give us something bigger were trading up we was looking for a bigger god damn dog because tippie had been teenie even before the truck came by the truck had made her teenier wider but teenier and we was looking for a bigger god damn dog not too big you know i dont like a dog whos bigger than i am its bad enough looking for shit in one direction without having to duck flying turds as well a good rule of thumb is keep the dogs asshole below eye level so we compromised and we got us a midsized dog knee high just about like this size here best size you can own by the way most people know this is the ideal size dog to have you know why anybody comes to visit you the first thing that dog does is take his nose and put it right in their crotch oohh oohh he smells my dog no marge i dont believe thats the animal he has in mind and people get embarrassed by that especially the owner of the dog the owners the one whos saying stop that stop that will you stop that now stop it im awfully sorry about this not me i say get in there and get some of that get in there and sniff that thing out go on listen would you mind spreading your legs a little bit so he can get right in there yeah stand like this for a little while would you okay looking good now so hows your mom and dad doing anyway well god bless them its a wonderful couple go around the back check it out in the back sniff that other thing in the back there whats that well theres two different smells he likes what can i tell you dont pay him no attention hell be finished in just about half an hour so listen reverend its real nice of you to come and call on us like this every one of us is always glad to see you around here especially that god damn dog those dogs are great theyll break the ice when a new neighbor comes to call hi were the johnsons whats his name ball sniffer hes a crotch hound let me know if you want to get circumcised hes on duty till  oclock dogs are a constant source of entertainment did you ever have a dog that ate cat turds some of them do some of you must know that did you ever have a dog eat cat turds yeah of course you got to have a cat you know you cant be buying cat turds at the supermarket but its true some dogs will eat cat turds yeah dont let them lick you that day get a bottle of listerine for him try to make him gargle pour it down his throat and tell him to howl come on howl howl god damn it stomp on his tail howl i said god damn it howl oh dogs are a lot of fun did you ever have a dog that ate a bunch of colored balloons and then he takes a shit and its real decorative like or sometimes at christmas theyll eat some tinsel and take a shiny shit wow look mom can we hang it on the tree well it is considered good luck in some cultures heres a little household hint for you this will help you clean up after your dogs feed your dog a lot of rubber bands put a lot of rubber bands in with his regular food then when he takes a shit theres usually a little loop in the end of it you just pick it up by the loop do you know what i mean throw it in the neighbors yard yeah thats why i travel around give these little household hints bet you never read that one in heloise huhyeah about time for me to get a little drink of water figure this stuff is safe to drink huh actually i dont care if its safe or not i drink it anyway you know why because im an american and i expect a little cancer in my food and water thats right im a loyal american and im not happy unless ive let government and industry poison me a little bit every day let me have a few hundred thousand carcinogens here ah a little cancer never hurt anybody everybody needs a little cancer i think its good for you keeps you on your toes besides i aint afraid of cancer i had broccoli for lunch broccoli kills cancer a lot of people dont know that its not out yet its true you find out you got some cancer get yourself a fucking bowl of broccoli thatll wipe it right out in a day or two cauliflower too cauliflower kills the really big cancers the ones you can see through clothing from across the street broccoli kills the little ones the ones that are slowly eating you away from inside while your god damn goofy halfeducated doctor keeps telling you youre doing fine jim in fact bring your doctor a bowel of broccoli hes probably got cancer too probably picked it up from you they dont know what theyre doing its all guesswork in a white coat here let me have a few more sips of industrial waste ah maybe maybe i can turn them cancers against one another thats what you got to hope for you know that you get more than one cancer so they eat each other up instead of you in fact the way i look at it the most cancer you got the healthier you are well i know some people dont like you to talk about those things i know that some people dont like you to mention certain things some people dont want you to say this some people dont want you to say that some people think if you mention some things they might happensome people are really fucking stupid did you ever notice that how many really stupid people you run into during the day god damn theres a lot of stupid bastards walking around carry a little pad and pencil with you you wind up with  or  names by the end of the day look at it this way think of how stupid the average person is and then realize half of them are stupider than that and it doesnt take you very long to spot one of them does it take you about eight seconds youll be listening to some guy and say this guy is fucking stupid then then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre full of shit huh that doesnt take very long to spot either does it take you about the same amount of time youll be listening to some guy saying well hes fairly intelligent ah hes full of shit then there are some people theyre not stupid theyre not full of shit theyre fucking nuts dan quayle is all three all three stupid full of shit and fucking nuts and where did he get that wife of his have you taken a good look at that marilyn quayle where did he get her at a halloween party or something she looks like prince charles for christs sake let me ask you something does he actually have to fuck that woman huh god help him i wouldnt fuck her with a stolen dickthats my political humor people like it when youre topical oh some people dont like you to talk like that oh some people would like to shut you up for saying those things you know that lots of people lots of groups in this country want to tell you how to talk tell you what you cant talk about sometimes theyll say well you can talk about something but you cant joke about it say you cant joke about it because its not funny comedians run into that shit all the time like rape theyll say you cant joke about rape rapes not funny i say fuck you i think its hilarious how do you like that i can prove to you that rape is funny picture porky pig raping elmer fudd see hey why do you think they call him porky huh i know what youre going to say elmer was asking for it elmer was coming on to porky porky couldnt help himself he got a hardon he got horny he lost control he went out of his mind lot of men talk like that lot of men think that way they think its the womans fault they like to blame the rape on the woman say hey she had it coming she was wearing a short skirt these guys think women ought to go to prison for being cock teasers dont seem fair to me dont seem right but you can joke about it i believe you can joke about anything it all depends on how you construct the joke what the exaggeration is what the exaggeration is because every joke needs one exaggeration every joke needs one thing to be way out of proportion give you an example did you ever see a news story like this is the paper every now and then you run into a story that says some guy broke into a house stole a lot of things and while he was in there he raped an  old woman and im thinking to myself why what the fuck kind of a social life does this guy have i want to say why did you do that well she was coming on to me we were dancing and i got horny hey she was asking for it she had on a tight bathrobe i say jesus christ be a little fucking selective next time will you now speaking of rape you know what i wonder i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole these are the kind of things i think about when im sitting home alone and the power goes out i wonder is there more rape at the equator or the north pole i mean per capita i know the populations are different most people think its the equator i think its the north pole people think its the equator because its hot down there they dont wear a lot of clothing guys can see womens tits they get horny and theres a lot of fucking going on thats exactly why theres less rape at the equator because theres a lot of fucking going on you can tell theres a lot of fucking at the equator take a look at the population figures billions of people life near the equator how many eskimos we got   no ones getting laid at the north pole its too fucking cold guys say to their wives hey tonight honey huh tonight huh are you crazy the wind chill factor is  below these guys are deprived theyre horny theyre pent up every now and then they bust out they got to rape somebody now the biggest problem an eskimo rapist has trying to get wet leather leggings off a woman whos kicking did you ever try to get leather pants off of someone who doesnt want to take them off you would lose your hard on in the process up at the north pole your dick would shrivel up like a stack of dimes thats another thing i wonder i wonder does a rapist have a hard on when he leaves the house in the morning or does he develop it during the day when hes walking around looking for somebody these are the kind of thoughts that kept me out of the really good schoolsnow i probably got the feminists all pissed off at me because im joking about rape feminists want to control your language feminists want to tell you how to talk and theyre not alone theyre not alone im not picking on the feminists they got a lot of company in this country theres a lot of groups lot of institutions in this country want to control your language tell you what you can say and what you cant say government wants to tell you some things you cant say because theyre against the law or you cant say this because its against a regulation or heres something you cant say because its a secret you cant tell him that because hes not cleared to know that government wants to control information and control language because thats the way you control thought and basically thats the game theyre insame with religion religion is nothing but mind control religion is just trying to control your mind control your thoughts so theyre going to tell you some things you shouldnt say because theyre sins and besides telling you things you shouldnt say religions going to suggest to you some things you ought to be saying heres something you ought to say first thing when you wake up in the morning heres something you ought to say just before you go to sleep at night heres something we always say on the third wednesday in april after the first full moon in spring at  when the bells ring religion is always suggesting things you ought to be saying same with political groups of all kinds political activists antibiased groups special interest groups are going to suggest the correct political vocabulary the way you ought to be saying things and thats where the feminists come innow as i said i got nothing against the feminists in fact i happen to agree with most of the feminist philosophy i have read i agree for instance that for the most part men are vain ignorant greedy brutal assholes whove just about ruined this planet\\u2026 whove just about ruined this planet because theyre afraid someone might have a bigger dick out there somewhere men are basically insecure about the size of their dicks and so they go to war over it you dont have to be a political scientist or a history major to see the bigger dick foreign policy theory at work it goes something like this what they have bigger dicks bomb them and of course the bombs and the bullets and the rockets are all shaped like dicks i dont understand that part of it but it is part of the equation so i agree with that abstract that man men males have pushed the technology that just about has this planet in a stranglehold mother earth raped again guess who eh she was asking for it i also happen to like it when feminists attack these fat ass housewives who think theres nothing more to life than sitting home on the telephone drinking coffee watching tv and pumping out a baby every nine months ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom ba boom will seven be enough bob ba boom ba boom but whats the alternative whats the alternative to pumping out a unit every nine months pointless careerism putting on a man tailored suit with shoulder pads and imitating all the worst behavior of men this is the noblest thing that women can think of to take a job in a criminal corporation thats poisoning the environment and robbing customers out of their money this is the worthiest thing they can think of isnt there something nobler they can do to be helping this planet heal you dont hear much about that from these middle class women ive noticed that most of these feminists are white middle class women they dont give a shit about black womens problems they dont care about latino women all theyre interested in is their own reproductive freedom and their pocketbooks but when it comes to changing the language i think they make some good points because we do think in language and so the quality of our thoughts and ideas could only be as good as the quality of our language so maybe some of this patriarchal shit ought to go away i think spokesmen ought to be spokesperson i think chairman ought to be chairperson i think mankind ought to be humankind but they take it too far they take themselves too seriously the exaggerate they want me to call that thing in the street a person hole cover i think thats taking it a little bit too far what would you call a ladys man a persons person that would make a heman an it person little kids would be afraid of the boogie person theyd look up in the sky and see the person in the moon guys would say come back here and fight like a person and wed all sing for its a jolly good person thats the kind of thing you would hear on late night with david letterperson you know what i mean so i think its an exaggeration and i like to piss off any group that takes itself a little bit too seriously and it does not take a lot of imagination to piss off a feminist all you got to do is run into now headquarters or ms magazine and say hey which one of you cute little cupcakes wants to come home and cook me a nice meal and give me a blow job blow job oh that pisses them off you want to piss off a feminist call her a cum catcher thatll get her attention ah dont act disgusted dont act disgusted half of you are going to go home and go down on each other tonight remember if youre willing to swallow cum lets not make believe something i said was disgusting okay all right lets not have a double standard here one standard will do just finenow speaking of blowjobs do you know why they call it a blowjob so itll sound like it has kind of a work ethic attached to it make you feel like you did something useful for the economy long as im being a complete pig up here let me ask you guys a question let me ask one question of the men are you ever able to watch a woman eating a banana and not think about a blowjob huh i cant do it i cant do it and i know why im a sick evil fuck i know that i accept that but i cant do it eating a banana eating a pickle licking on an ice cream cone im saying to myself look at the tongue on her wow so you women be careful when youre standing out in front of that hagen daas because god damn it were watching and god damn it were thinking another womans issue prostitution i do not understand why prostitution is illegal why should prostitution be illegal selling is legal fucking is legal why isnt selling fucking legal you know why should it be illegal to sell something thats perfectly legal to give away i cant follow the logic on that at all of all the things you can do too a person giving someone an orgasm is hardly the worst thing in the world in the army they give you a medal for spraying napalm on people civilian life you go to jail for giving someone an orgasm maybe im not supposed to understand iti got strange ideas anyway you know what i think they ought to do with that miss american contest i think they ought to make the losers keep coming back until they win ill tell you that would get a little spooky after about  years or so huh i just want to work on world peace fine sit down before you fall down will you and pick up all these goddamn batons i got a lot of ideas you know what i think i think kleenex ought to have little targets on them wouldnt that be a good idea little bulls eyes right in the middle of the kleenex make it kind of sporting when youre with your friends blowing nose sound look dave an  thats a good idea i got a lot of good ideas trouble is most of them suck i got a lot of good ideas for new products like that thats what i think about on my off duty hours things we need products we ought to have that we dont have you know what we ought to have we ought to have a diet salad dressing called  islands see good god damn ideas like that huh a christian deodorant thou shalt not smell how about a feminine hygiene spray called sprunt huh well youd never forget the name would you it would always be on the tip of your tongue see marketing marketing thats where i belong among other places marketing heres an idea i got this is a yoyo with a  string you use it when you visit the grand canyon see im a visionary im ahead of my time trouble is im only about an hour and a half ahead heres a good idea a light bulb that only shines on things worth looking at yeah kind of too idealistic never make any money on a thing like that heres something thats going to make you a fortune get in on this this is a roach spray it doesnt kill the roaches but it fills them with selfdoubt as to whether or not theyre in the right house yeah heres something im trying to interest the japanese electronics firms in this this would be a great product for sony this is a combination cassette player and colostomy bag its called shitman huh sure well you never see that you never see that you never see a guy jogging down the street listening to a shitman no thats one of those things you never see

life you and your fianc\\u00e9 have been invited to your mom and dads house for dinner for the first time halfway through dinner your fianc\\u00e9 stands up and says ill be right back i got to take a dump there seems to be no really gentile way of announcing publicly a dump and frankly im not impressed with people who tell me what theyre going to do when they go to the bathroom in the first place doesnt it bother you people that announce it ill be right back im going to take a shit never mind do what you have to do and leave me out of it and dont describe it when you come back boy you should have seen\\u2026 never mind it set off the smoke alarm never mind i have never understood that nor have a cared for itsomething else i dont care for these organ donor programs that shit bother you a little bit sounds like josef mengeles been sitting on some of those meetings or something organ donor programs the thing that bothers me the most about it is theyre run by the motor vehicle bureau i figure hey shit you got to wait on a line that long for a kidney fuck it do without its the motor vehicle bureau in most states who send you the little card youre supposed to carry right next to your wallet right next to your drivers license in your wallet little card youre supposed to fill it out and on it youre supposed to list the organs youre willing to give in case you die are these people out of their fucking minds or something do you honestly believe that if a paramedic finds that card on you in an automobile accident hes going to try to save your life bullshit hes looking for parts man absolutely look dan heres that lower intestine weve been looking for never mind the oxygen this mans a donor bullshit they want something of mine they can have my rectum and my anus thats all im giving take them and get out of here put them in your bag and get the fuck out of my life thats all im giving i dont want some guy poking around in me hoping i die i want to live i dont want to die thats the whole secret of life not dying i figured that shit out alone in third gradeand dont be pulling any plugs on me either heres another bunch of macho asshole bullshit floating around this country people talking about ah pull the plug on me if im ever like that if im comatose if im like a vegetable pull the plug on me fuck you leave my plug alone get an extension cord for my plug i want everything you got tubes cords plugs probes electrodes ivs you got something stick it in me man you find out i got a hole i didnt know i had put a fucking plug in it vegetable shit i dont care if i look like an artichoke save my ass theres three things i want if im ever in that condition three things i got to have ice cream morphine and television you give me that ice cream every two hours give me that morphine about\\u2026 every ten minutes and turn on the fucking tv i want to see geraldo and dont be coming to visit me i got no time for life people im brain dead here you people got no respect for the brain dead hey you got to be brain dead to watch geraldo in the first place you might as well watch him when youre clinically brain dead theres one other thing i thought about concerning this comatose thing and this might help you someday this little piece of information might come in handy sometime in the future if youre in this circumstance if you knew a family if you knew a family and one of them was a homosexual and he was in an automobile accident and he was comatose you could always comfort that family by saying well look at it this way he was a fruit now hes a vegetable listen at least hes still in the produce sectionnow i probably got some other group pissed off at me because i said fruit theres a different group to get pissed off at you in this country for everything youre not supposed to say cant say fruit cant say faggot cant say queer cant say nancy boy cant say pansy cant say ngger boogie jig jiggaboo skinhead jungle bunny moolie moolie yan or schwarz cant say yid heeb zeeb kike mackie dego ginny wop ginzo greaser greaseball spick beaner oya tiger pr mick donkey turkey limey frog squarehead kraut jerry hun chink jap nip slope slopehead zip zipper head gook there is absolutely nothing wrong\\u2026 there is absolutely nothing wrong with any of those words in and of themselves theyre only words its the context that counts its the user its the intention behind the words that makes them good or bad the words are completely neutral the words are innocent i get tired of people talking about bad words and bad language bullshit its the context that makes them good or bad the context that makes them good or bad for instance you take the word ngger there is absolutely nothing wrong with the word ngger in and of itself its the racist asshole thats using it that you ought to be concerned about we dont care when richard pryor or eddie murphy says it why because we know theyre not racists theyre nggers context context we dont mind their context because we know theyre black hey i know im whitey the blueeyed devil patio fake gray boy honkie motherfucker myself dont bother my ass theyre only words you cant be afraid of words that speak the truth even if its an unpleasant truth like the fact that theres a bigot and a racist in every living room on every street corner in this country i dont like words that hide the truth i dont like words that conceal reality i dont like euphemisms or euphemistic language and american english is loaded with euphemisms because americans have a lot of trouble dealing with reality americans have trouble facing the truth so they invent the kind of a soft language to protect themselves from it and it gets worse with every generation for some reason it just keeps getting worseill give you an example of that theres a condition in combat most people know about it its when a fighting persons nervous system has been stressed to its absolute peak and maximum cant take any more input the nervous system has either snapped or is about to snap in the first world war that condition was called shell shock simple honest direct language two syllables shell shock almost sounds like the guns themselves that was  years ago then a whole generation went by and the second world war came along and the very same combat condition was called battle fatigue four syllables now it takes a little longer to say doesnt seem to hurt as much fatigue is a nicer word than shock shell shock battle fatigue then we had the war in korea in  madison avenue was riding high by that time and the very same combat condition was called operational exhaustion hey were up to eight syllables now and the humanity has been squeezed completely out of the phrase its totally sterile now operational exhaustion sounds like something that might happen to your car then of course came the war in viet nam which has only been over for about  or  years and thanks to the lies and deceits surrounding that war i guess its no surprise that the very same condition was called posttraumatic stress disorder still eight syllables but weve added a hyphen and the pain is completely buried under jargon posttraumatic stress disorder i bet you if wed have still been calling it shell shock some of them viet nam veterans might have gotten the attention they needed at the time but it didnt happen and one of the reasons is because we were using that soft language that language that takes the life out of lifeand it is a function of time it does keep getting worse give you another example sometime during my life sometime during my life toilet paper became bathroom tissue i wasnt notified of this no one asked me if i agreed with it it just happenedtoilet paper became bathroom tissue sneakers became running shoes false teeth became dental appliances medicine became medication information became directory assistance the dump became the landfill car crashes became automobile accidents partly cloudy became partly sunny motels became motor lodges house trailers became mobile homes used cars became previously owned transportation room service became guest room dining and constipation became occasional irregularity when i was a little kid if i got sick they wanted me to go to the hospital and see the doctor now they want me to go to a health maintenance organization or a wellness center to consult a healthcare delivery professional poor people used to live in slums now the economically disadvantaged occupies substandard housing in the inner cities and theyre broke theyre broke they dont have a negative cash flow position theyre fucking broke because a lot of them were fired you know fired management wanted to curtail redundancies in the human resources area so many people are no longer viable members of the workforce smug greedy wellfed white people have invented a language to conceal their sins its as simple as that the cia doesnt kill anybody any more they neutralize people or they depopulate the area the government doesnt lie it engages in disinformation the pentagon actually measures nuclear radiation and something they call sunshine units israeli murderers are called commandos arab commandos are called terrorists contra killers are called freedom fighters well if crime fighters fight crime and firefighters fight fire what do freedom fighters fight they never mention that part of it to us do they never mention that part of itsome of this stuff is just silly we all know that like on the airlines they say they want to pre board well what the hell is pre board what does that mean to get on before you get onthey say theyre going to pre board those passengers in need of special assistance cripples simple honest direct language theres no shame attached to the word cripple that i can find in any dictionary no shame attached to it in fact its a word used in bible translations jesus healed the cripples doesnt take seven words to describe that condition but we dont have any cripples in this country any more we have the physically challenged is that a grotesque enough evasion for youhow about differently abled ive heard them called that differently abled you cant even call these people handicapped anymore theyll say were not handicapped were handy capable these poor people have been bullshitted by the system into believing that if you change the name of the condition somehow youll change the condition well hey cousin doesnt happen doesnt happenwe have no more deaf people in this country hearing impaired no ones blind any more partially sighted or visually impaired we have no more stupid people everybody has a learning disorder or hes minimally exceptional how would you like to be told that about your child hes minimally exceptional oh thank god for that psychologists actually have started calling ugly people those with severe appearance deficitsits getting so bad that any day now i expect to hear a rape victim referred to as an unwilling sperm recipient and we have no more old people in this country no more old people we shipped them all away and we brought in these senior citizens isnt that a typically american  century phrase bloodless lifeless no pulse in one of them a senior citizen and ive accepted that one ive come to terms with it i know its here to stay well never get rid of it thats what theyre going to be called so ill relax on that but the one i do resist the one i keep resisting is when they look at an old guy and they say look at him dan hes  years young imagine the fear of aging that reveals to not even be able to use the word old to describe someone to have to use an antonym and fear of aging is natural its universal isnt it we all have that no one wants to get old no one wants to die but we do so we bullshit ourselves i started bullshitting myself when i got to my s soon as i was in my s id look in the mirror and id say well i guess im getting older older sounds a little better than old doesnt it sounds like it might even last a little longer bullshit im getting old and its okay because thanks to our fear of death in this country i wont have to die ill pass away or ill expire like a magazine subscription if it happens in the hospital theyll call it a terminal episode the insurance company will refer to it as negative patient care outcome and if its the result of malpractice theyll say it was a therapeutic misadventure im telling you some of this language makes me want to vomit well maybe not vomit makes me want to engage in an involuntary personal protein spillthank you
